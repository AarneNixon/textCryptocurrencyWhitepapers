INTRODUCTION

WHITE PAPER

INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION
BUZZcoin™ is a non-profit blockchain implementation that aims to help save the worlds
declining bee population.
By implementing blockchain technology into
existing bee hives BUZZcoin aims to create a
worldwide data network that collects beehive
health data. The project brings together a diverse group of experts, developing a smart hive
device prototype that will soon enter its field
testing phase.
BUZZcoin is supporting the global effort to save
the bees by providing collected data to scientific
projects and organizations that focus on saving
the worlds bee population. By providing this
data to the network and being able to get highly
accurate data from the hives, beekeepers are
rewarded in cryptocurrency for their data collection. This will ensure a wide spread usage of
the smart hive devices.
The core team's main focus when they started the BC-HMD™ Device development back in
October 2017 was collecting industry specific
research, primarily focusing on the smart hive
technology. The teams experience in various
industries is the driving force behind the prototype development. Transitioning the architecture of BUZZcoin from a proof-of-stake coin into
one of the very few existing cryptocurrencies
that have a real world application.
The network data provided - coupled with the
features of a modern blockchain implementation - can truly revolutionize the entire beekeeping industry.

CORE TEAM

CORE TEAM
The BUZZcoin™ core team consists of a decentralized group of experts from all around the
world. Bringing together solid technical and soft
skills, as well as an extensive network of powerful connections.
The team was originally formed in October 2017
to develop the BC-HMD™ prototype. In December 2017 it became apparent that the direction
of the then existing core team wasn't utilizing
the full potential of the BUZZcoin project.
In January 2018 it was decided that the team
developing the BC-HMD prototype was better suited to take on the core development

TECHNICAL
PROOF OF WORK
PROOF OF STAKE
BUZZcoin™ 3.2 is currently based on PoW and
PoS.

HEXAGON Algorithm: SHA256d
HEXAGON Reward: 10 BUZZ per Block
HEXAGON New Block every minute on average
HEXAGON Variable POS ROI rewards
HEXAGON 20 billion (20,000,000,000) maximum supply
HEXAGON 5% development fee on every POS stake

Please note POW was disabled when BUZZCOIN
reached max-supply. Since BUZZcoin 3.2, BUZZ
is running on POS only and is therefor highly energy efficient and environmental friendly.

All technical details are subject to change with
the release of BUZZcoin 4.0.

DEVELOPMENT FEE
Due to the lack of an ICO, the BUZZcoin development team decided to allow 85% of the
Proof of Stake coins to be generated without
a development fee. When 17 billion coins had
been generated a development fee of 5% was
implemented. It will allow generation of around
150,000,000 in BUZZ for the development team
before Maximum Supply is reached. To manage

PROOF OF STAKE DETAILS
Proof of Stake is an algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network achieves consensus by using existing coins to confirm new
blocks.
For more information please see:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake

Single User Wallet Node Only
Support
In the past with Proof of Stake, staking pools
massively undermined the health of the BUZZcoin network. We firmly do not support Staking
Pools as they go against the principles of a decentralized Proof of Stake blockchain network.
BUZZcoin™ only supports single user wallet
nodes.

Year Percentage Reward Algorithm
Year % = ( 1200 - ( 1200 * (Current Supply / Max Supply) )
For example, at a current supply value of 19,500,000,000 at the time of this writing,
the yearly reward algorithm follows these basic mathematical principles:

Year % = ( 1200 - ( 1200 * (19,500,000,000 / 20,000,000,000) )
Year % = ( 1200 - ( 1200 * ( 0.975 ) )
Year % = 1200 - 1170
Year % = 30%
The maturation time is 2 hours.

Maximum Supply
The Maximum Supply is set to a value of 20 billion (20,000,000,000). At this maximum supply value,
Proof of Work and Proof of Stake rewards will be turned off. Please note that BUZZcoin has hit
Maximum Supply on June 6th 2019. Transaction fees are constantly burned and deducted from
the circulating supply. These burned fees are constantly available as staking rewards.
