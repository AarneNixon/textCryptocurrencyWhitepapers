WHAT IS

LUXCORE & WHY?
Underlying technologies of applications we use and how
enterprises carry out their businesses are already being
transformed by the advent of blockchain technology. Along
with smart contracts, the world is in the process of moving to
a trustless, paperless and secure economy, be it the transfer of
data, assets, legal contracts or even for entertainment. While
Bitcoin led us on this revolutionary path, the landscape of
blockchain technology has seen tremendous technological
advancement in the past few years with the help of many
innovative blockchain projects.

LUXCORE’s open-source blockchain includes the groundbreaking, energy-efficient, ASIC resistant algorithm PHI1612;
the tradeable commodity, Lux Coin; Masternodes that act as
a network security and rewarding system; Smart Contracts;
and SegWit for improved transaction size and malleability.

We have already seen the power of distributed ledgers as a
single source of truth: in financial transactions, improvement
in network stability and consensus rules, decentralized treasury
systems, secure anonymous and private transactions of data,
significant increase of transaction speeds, digital contracts,
DAOs, DApps and even cross blockchain communication
systems.

LUXCORE will provide a set of unique protocols and tools for
easy integration across businesses that requires secure intraorganizational blockchain or permissioned blockchain networks.
With its upcoming consulting arm, the company aims to set up,
maintain, and improve such networks for organizations and
institutions.

But very few companies offer customizable and bespoke
blockchain solutions for end users, enterprise and institutions
that incorporate the best features of the current blockchains
while being industry agnostic.

4

The closed-source products, focused on service providers,
enterprises and institutions, include Parallel Masternodes
(PMN), LuxGate, PoS Enabled Web Wallet, DApps and
blockchain implementation and consulting services.

Other blockchain solutions take an Us vs. Big Business or Us
vs. Governments approach. LUXCORE’s blockchain solution
and IT Services are built to help all three parties by allowing
various levels of features and security for the user as required.

Privacy & Security

Cherry-Picked Solutions

While many of the blockchain solutions focus
on individual user privacy and security through
cloaking or different forms of coin mixing,
LUXCORE extends a superior private network
approach to security through LuxGate and
PMN which is encrypted via SAM protocol &
i2pd technology. These products offer clients
a secure blockchain-based channel for data and
functional transactions.

Each of the major blockchains in existence
today has championed one or the other feature,
be it Masternodes, anonymous transactions,
Smart Contracts, or SegWit to expand their
use case. LUXCORE has cherry picked some of
these significant attributes and brought them
together under one ecosystem.

Enterprise-Ready
Architecture

Scalable Ecosystem

Apart from the security of private networks
running its own chain, by using LuxGate,
enterprises and institutions will be able to access
and run domain specific DApps or customized
applications on their private networks. These can
be deployed on location or on the cloud as per
requirement.

LUXCORE WHITEPAPER V2.0 - 2018

The number of private networks or permissioned
blockchains that can be integrated through
LuxGate and PMN are unlimited. Each of these
chains could run a specific application or have a
specific functionality embedded.

LUXCORE BLOCKCHAIN

LUXCORE BLOCKCHAIN
The word LUX is LIGHT in Latin. By offering a faster, more efficient, more secure and private transaction solution for individuals,
institutions, and governments, LUXCORE sheds a new light on the mainstream usability of blockchains.
LUXCORE’s PHI1612 presents the most efficient ASIC-resistant GPU mining algorithm, with faster hash rates and reduction of power
and heat consumption by 10%. This is scientifically verifiable the details of which will be made available in the technical paper.
LUXCORE blockchain features are available to end users at no extra cost. Anyone who uses the commodity LUX Coin can access
the blockchain using LUXCORE wallets or mine to support the network and earn rewards. The security features of the blockchain
are also available for everyone. As a hybrid chain that supports both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, the chain is more secure
than traditional ones. The seed nodes, full nodes, and wallets that are unlocked for staking, also provide further network stability.

Specifics and Rewards
There are three distinct ways for miners and commodity owners to be rewarded:
Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Masternodes.

PROOF-OF-WORK (POW)

PROOF-OF-STAKE (POS)

FEATURES
LUX MASTERNODES

SEGWIT

Any computer mining LUX or staking LUX is considered a node
or connection to the blockchain network. The more nodes, the
stronger the network. A Masternode is a 24/7/365 dedicated
server connected to the blockchain network that further
enhances the network stability and supports the LuxSend
functionality. To run a Masternode, a user is required to have
16,120 LUX in a wallet.

Through the introduction of SegWit, LUX will separate
transaction signatures. This is achieved by stripping the
signature from within the input and structuring it to the end
of a transaction. This ensures higher security as it prevents
the receiver from intercepting and modifying the sender’s
transaction ID in a bid to get more coins from the sender as the
data is “detached” from the transaction.

Masternode owners earn rewards for supporting the network
and providing the additional services. These rewards are called
Proof-of-Service rewards. The Proof-of-Service payment comes
from 40% of the Proof-of-Stake and are randomly paid to the
Masternode owners. Currently the Masternode system is being
rewarded 0.4 LUX and the PoS is being rewarded 0.6 LUX for
every PoS block found.

With a current block size of 4MB and block time of 60 seconds,
the addition of SegWit will effectively increase transaction size
and address transaction malleability issues currently plaguing
blockchains. This will prove critical in the scalability of the
LUXCORE blockchain. This paves the way for the introduction of
Lightning Network in the future.

SMART CONTRACTS
Enable the unification of blockchains through LuxGate and PMN. These Smart Contracts can be deployed directly from the wallet and can
trigger cross-network transactions and tasks based on pre-defined conditions.
This enables the technical scaling of the network to build Enterprise DApps on the LUXCORE chain. Smart Contract transactions will benefit
from other features like improved scalability, privacy, low fees, and security.

TRADING WALLET

LUXSEND

LUXCORE’s trading enabled wallet will let you stake your coins
and trade them too! Exchanges are not the safest place for your
LUX, and when your LUX coins are on the exchange, you will not
receive any PoS reward. The trading wallet allows you to trade
your coins directly from your wallet.

is a form of coin-mixing that provides an additional layer
of privacy. The coin-mixing service provided by the LUX
Masternode Network will ensure trustless mixing of coins to
obfuscate their origin, wallet details, and addresses. LuxSend
also enables instant transactions.

MULTI-SIGNATURES
With a view on security in mind, LUX will have Multi-Signatures enabled. No longer will funds be under a single point of control or failure. This gives
users yet another level of security while using LUX Coin.
Here are some use cases of Multi-Signature Transactions:
1-of-2 Signatures can authorize the transaction. A couple may share a joint LUX account and have two separate signatures. Either of the two is sufficient
to authorize a transaction.
2-of-2 Signatures A couple share a joint account, but both parties’ signatures are required to authorize a transaction, thus preventing one party from
moving the LUX without the approval of the other.
The number
of Signatures
can be asV2.0

For example, LUX development and business funds will be held in multi-signature accounts requiring 2-5 or 3-5 signatures.

LUXCORE

PRODUCTS
LUXCORE’s core products are closed source and will typically follow a licensing or subscription-based model. Core products along
with blockchain features, such as Smart Contracts and SegWit, enable customers to create a single private sustainable ecosystem
for their business needs.

POS ENABLED WEB WALLET
LUXCORE’s Web Wallet is the first and only PoS Enabled Web Wallet in the blockchain space that does not pool coins
for staking. This product is now live and enables staking at 0% energy usage for the end user who does not have to leave
their computer open.

POS

Our unique web wallet will remain free for LUX users and is available here: http://lux.poswallet.io/
PoS Enabled Web Wallet-as-a-Service will be licensed to other blockchain assets and providers in the market with
customizations and service add-ons. The Licenses and Service options for the PoS Web Wallet-as-a-Service will be
available for purchase using LUXCoin, thus adding value to the LUXCoin economy.

LUXGATE
is nothing short of a technological marvel in the blockchain space. LuxGate will allow communication between validated
blockchains with the ability to perform advanced functions and tasks.
In simple layman terms, LuxGate, with the help of Parallel Masternodes, acts as a cross-blockchain unifying bond
between two different ecosystems.
For example, the Bitcoin blockchain can engage with Ethereum blockchain or Monero blockchain or Zcash blockchain.

PARALLEL MASTERNODES
The enablement of this private network aims to address reliable and secure needs of enterprises and institutions.
This feature is built on the revolutionary i2pd Technology and SAM Protocol thus enhancing LUX’s security capability.
The Parallel Masternodes will only be available to verified and vetted business and government institutions and will act
as a secure information gateway on the blockchain.
Any function, wallet, or transaction on the Parallel Masternode will be encrypted with the ip addresses auto-changed.
These wallets and transactions are invisible to prying eyes to meet institutional security prerequisites.

PERMISSIONED BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPMENT & CONSULTING SERVICES:
LUXCORE will provide bespoke permissioned blockchain creation and customization services.
With the help of LuxGate and PMN, these private networks will be able to communicate with similar chains and could
have their own specific features, for example, a different transaction throughput or even a completely different protocol.
This will follow the specific requirements of the customer and can have different features from the LUXCORE public
blockchain. This will also provide flexibility to enterprise users and may be maintained and managed by the LUXCORE
operational team as required.

DAPPS
LUXCORE will develop and deploy both free and freemium model DApps for the end users. These may be used in
conjunction with the Smart Contract feature.
Business DApps will also be developed considering possible requirements and needs of the enterprise users. These may
be exclusive for a specific business and deployed directly on the private network.

Custom DApp solutions and business application integration through PMN and LuxGate will enable cross network
usage.

LUXGATE & PARALLEL MASTERNODES
FUNCTIONALITY & HIGH LEVEL USE CASES

LuxGate will be able to interact with centralized functions (e.g. banking
institutions) along with the PMN private network, which will act as an
autonomous system on behalf of the function. LUXCORE will provide
the required technology assistance and consultancy services to set
up PMN and will support the deployment of the private network for
private institutions. These networks will be centralized trustworthy
environments and will be verifiable by the customer to validate
legitimacy of the transactions.
With the help of this functionality LUXCORE aims to disrupt the
traditional banking transactional systems. LuxGate and PMN can
work cross algorithm and will be system agnostic compared to other
blockchain competitors in this space. A specific feature from a security
perspective is the ability of LuxGate and PMN to strengthen two layers
of differing safety algorithms to be unified at a combined strength level.
LuxGate and PMN, together, enable the deployment of Permissioned
Blockchains and support the interoperability between networks and
chains. Permissioned blockchains are key to the creation of private
networks for organizations with different features from the main
LUXCORE blockchain.
