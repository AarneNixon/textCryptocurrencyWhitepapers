Abstract
In this paper, we offer an overview of the district0x Network, a collective of decentralized
marketplaces and communities, hereafter referred to as districts.
Districts exist as decentralized entities, built upon a standard open source framework
comprised of Ethereum smart contracts and front-end libraries, hereafter referred to as
d0xINFRA.
d0xINFRA provides districts with core functionalities that are necessary to operate an
online marketplace or community. Namely, the ability for users to post listings, filter and
search through listings, rank peers and amass reputation, and send invoices and collect
payments. The d0xINFRA framework is designed to be open and extendable, allowing
districts to be customized and granted additional functionality through the use of auxiliary
modules.
We also introduce the district0x Network Token in order to facilitate open participation
and coordination across the network while providing protections from malicious actors.
The district0x Network Token is a multi-utility token which is required for application to
the district0x Network, utilized in an incentivized voting game to dictate access to a suite
of ancillary services exclusive to network members, used to signal support or disapproval
for proposals made by network participants, and which can be staked to deposit pools to
mint tokens providing district-specific rights on third-party platforms.

Introduction
In recent years, the economic powers of decentralization have materialized. Uber has
disintermediated transportation and achieved a valuation of $69B1. Airbnb has made
similar disruptions in the lodging sector, giving them a value of $31B2 by most recent
measures. Entrenched conglomerates are being uprooted by upstarts who realize that
value is in the network effect of their users, rather than the cost of physical assets they
own or expend.
While customers of these services have enjoyed lower prices and better user
experiences relative to those available in the past, they are still subject to higher costs
than they would be without for-profit third-parties extracting fees and they have little say
over the evolution of these platforms. Despite business models relying upon sustaining
massive user bases that allow them to operate at scale, users have no means of
participating in the value creation reaped from their use of these centrally controlled
platforms. Until recent advancements in trustless network design, network participants
had few reliable means for self-organizing without a centralized party.
The advent and subsequent development of the Ethereum protocol has opened the door
for experimentation in decentralized organizational structures and the distribution of
governance rights to a network’s participants. Projects such as ​Aragon​, ​Boardroom​,
Colony​, and ​Giveth​ are actively working to harness the powers of Ethereum for these
purposes, building platforms that enable non-technical users to create and administrate
decentralized organizations. These tools allow for new means of group coordination
through economic incentives, making it possible to disintermediate marketplaces and
communities and to allocate voting rights to their participants. In short, citizens of the
internet can now build and control the platforms they frequent every day.
Utilizing the aforementioned technologies, the district0x Network will facilitate the
operation and governance of marketplaces and communities as decentralized entities.
The district0x Network will enable the recreation of many of the internet’s most popular
applications and services while eliminating rent-seeking and the relinquishment of
decisions and personal data to third-parties.

Districts
The district0x Network is comprised of districts. Districts are markets and communities
that exist as decentralized entities built upon the d0xINFRA framework.
At the core of every district are components necessary to operate a marketplace or
bulletin board application. All districts provide the following baseline functionalities:
●
●
●
●

Posting and listings
Search and filtering
Ranking and reputation
Payments and invoicing

These capabilities are tied together and made accessible to users via list, thumbnail, and
gallery-style user interfaces, popularized by online services such as Craigslist and Reddit.

Ethlance
Launched on the Ethereum MainNet in January 2017, ​Ethlance​ is a freelance job market
and the first district of the district0x Network.

6
Ethlance allows users to create an employer/employee profile, list and apply for open
positions, rank and provide feedback for employers/employees, and to send/receive
invoices. Ethlance does not charge any service fees, and users pay only the necessary
cost of gas to broadcast their profiles, posts, messages, feedback, and invoices to the
Ethereum network.
Ethlance’s code is completely open-source at ​github.com/district0x/ethlance​. Ethlance’s
front-end source files are written in Clojurescript and served via ​IPFS​. Ethlance’s backend
logic is governed by 14 smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum MainNet (Appendix A).
Since its launch, over 410 users have created a profile and more than 190 open positions
have been listed. Projects such as ​Status​, ​Aragon​, ​Colony​, ​WeTrust​, ​Rex​, ​JAAK​, and
Giveth​ are amongst those currently hiring via Ethlance.
As the original district, Ethlance serves as an experimental sandbox for the creation and
refinement of the d0xINFRA framework and will be developed in perpetuity alongside
other districts deployed by the district0x team.

Name Bazaar
The second district to be deployed to the district0x Network will be ​Name Bazaar​, a
peer-to-peer marketplace for the exchange of names registered via the ​Ethereum Name
Service​. Name Bazaar intends to provide an easily discoverable registry of ENS names
that have been made available for purchase by their owners.
Amongst available options, owners will be able to choose to open customized auctions
or list their names for sale at fixed prices. Sellers will have the option of setting their
prices in ETH or any ERC20 token.
Name Bazaar will also allow for the trading of subdomains, enabling the exchange of
usernames in decentralized applications such as ​Status​ and organization names in the
Aragon Network Company Registry​.

Meme Factory
Inspired by the work of Simon de la Rouviere and his ​Curation Markets​ design, the third
district to be deployed to the district0x Network is ​Meme Factory​. Meme Factory will
allow users to mint their own tokenized memes and offer them for sale immediately.

7
Meme Factory will provide an interface for the creation of provably rare digital assets on
the Ethereum blockchain which can be immediately posted to a bulletin board-style
marketplace for exchange.
Tokenizing and posting a meme to Meme Factory will resemble the process of creating a
new post on Reddit. Minting a tokenized meme will resemble the process of upvoting.
The number of tokens in existence for a particular meme at any given time will act as the
ranking mechanism, resembling the number of upvotes a post has received. These
functions will be tied together with a Curation Market model, with the cost of minting and
the rates at which one can redeem their memes governed by a scaling pricing curve.

Future Districts
Following the launch of Meme Factory, the district0x team intends to continue to
introduce new districts to the district0x Network. The district0x Network makes use of an
open proposal process, allowing all community members to submit ideas for new districts
via the ​district0x GitHub​.
The district0x Network Token offers a means for network participants to signal which
districts they would like to see built and deployed to the network next, enabling holders
to coordinate around ideas which will add the most utility. Signaling is currently facilitated
via the ​District Proposal Voting dApp​, a customized implementation of ​CarbonVote​.

District Creation Platform
The district0x Network will ultimately be comprised of global marketplaces and
hyperlocal communities alike. The district creation platform will provide users with an
easy to use interface to design and deploy their own districts to the district0x Network.
The district creation platform will provide a way to customize the parameters of the smart
contracts powering a district and will offer numerous UI options to support a wide variety
of markets and communities. The district creation interface will feature an auxiliary
module directory, similar to the ​Apple App Store​, to allow for the easy discovery of
plugins that extend the functionality and utility of districts.

8

d0xINFRA
d0xINFRA is an open source framework comprised of Ethereum smart contracts and
front-end libraries that govern the deployment of new districts to the network and
provide their baseline functionalities.
Each district’s backend logic will be controlled by a combination of d0xINFRA contracts
shared by all districts on the network and a set of district-specific contracts. Similarly, for
the front-end, districts will share reusable components where possible, primarily
‘under-the-hood’ front-end logic, while still allowing for broad visual UI diversity.

The district0x Network seeks to be home to a vast array of markets and communities. In
accordance with this vision, d0xINFRA has been designed as an open and extendable
modular system that allows districts to implement unique features and enhanced
functionality via the plug-in of auxiliary modules (covered in the following section).

9

Auxiliary Modules
To allow for the development and deployment of new features, functionality, and
revenue generating mechanisms to districts, districts can be customized and extended
through the use of auxiliary modules.
An example of an auxiliary module that could potentially generate revenue for a district,
is one which provides a mechanism for users to bid on premium placement of their
listings, similar to Google AdWords.
Another example of a potential revenue generating auxiliary module, is one which allows
for the optional insurance of proposals on the platform. One could imagine a third-party
service deploying a module to offer financial guarantees on arrangements between
users of the platform in exchange for a fee.
An example of an auxiliary module that can enhance the user experience of a district is a
moderation mechanism that allows for the flagging and takedown of spam, malicious
links, or explicit content.
Districts will decide on a district by district basis what auxiliary modules are implemented
via their governance processes.
Third parties are encouraged to develop and contribute auxiliary modules to district0x.
They are incentivized to do so via the ability to charge districts fees for usage rights.

10

Governance by Aragon
Launched in 2017, ​Aragon​ is an operating system for decentralized entities. The Aragon
platform provides an easy to use interface for creating, administering, and governing
virtual entities.
Aragon allows for user-friendly management of the basic components of an entity such
as voting right distribution, role assignments, and accounting. The behavior of an Aragon
entity can be customized by changing its bylaws.
The creation of a district on the district0x Network will trigger the creation of a deposit
pool and corresponding entity on the Aragon Network. Through the district0x Network
Token staking interface, token holders can stake their tokens to deposit pools to mint
tokens which represent voting rights in district-specific Aragon entities, via which all of
the district’s governance activities will occur.
Voting rights can be used to partake in the processes that determine the characteristics
of a district ranging from its design, to its functionality, to its accepted code of conduct, to
the integrations it utilizes, and beyond.
Aragon entities created for districts will come preconfigured with a suggested set of
bylaws and parameters, but district participants can vote to change these as they see fit.

11

The District Registry
The District Registry is a decentrally maintained district whitelist, storing the credentials
of districts which have been granted access to the district0x Network. The presence of a
district in the District Registry signifies that the district has been accredited by district0x
Network Token holders as non-malicious and value-additive to the district0x Network.
Inclusion in the District Registry grants a district access to a suite of ancillary services
exclusive to members of the district0x Network. Registered districts are also eligible for
inclusion in the district0x Network Token staking interface, whereby token holders can
stake their DNT to a district’s deposit pool to mint voting rights in the respective district’s
Aragon entity.
A user interface will allow token holders to submit new district proposals to the District
Registry, challenge proposals, and vote for or against proposals in any ongoing voting
period. Additionally, token holders can vote to alter parameters for the District Registry at
large through the same interface.

Proposals and Deposits
To seek placement in the District Registry, authors of qualifying district proposals must
submit a deposit of district0x Network Tokens along with their completed proposal to the
District Registry’s application pool. This application will remain idle until the challenge
period passes.
If no challenge is raised during this period, the district will be included in the District
Registry and the initial deposit will be transferred to the district’s deposit pool on behalf
of the applicant, assigning the initial voting rights in the corresponding Aragon entity to
the applicant. Additionally, before any challenge occurs, the author may choose to
withdraw their application, reclaiming their deposit and forfeiting their chance for
inclusion in the District Registry until a later application is made. Applicants may apply for
placement in the District Registry as frequently as desired.

Challenges
At any point during or after the challenge period, any district0x Network Token holder
may choose to challenge a listing’s inclusion within the District Registry by sending an
equivalent deposit amount to the application pool. This initiates a voting period, during

12
which DNT holders across the network may vote in favor or against the inclusion of the
proposal in the District Registry. Votes are weighted according to a user’s DNT balance,
and are partially locked in a commit-reveal process inspired by ​Colony’s voting system​.
If at the end of the voting period, vote counts are weighted in favor of inclusion to the
District Registry, the application succeeds and the challenger’s deposit is forfeited.
Likewise, if vote counts are weighted against inclusion to the Registry, the application is
rejected, and the applicant’s deposit is forfeited.
In both cases, a portion of the forfeited deposit gets distributed as a reward to voters on
the winning side of the vote in proportion with their vote size, and the depositor of the
winning side has their deposit returned. Voters from both sides never have funds at
stake, and will have their voting tokens returned to them in full regardless of the outcome
of the challenge. Applicants and challengers stand to lose their deposit from losing the
vote, while voters only stand to gain from participation.

Parameterization
All numeric parameters of the District Registry are flexible, and can themselves be voted
on for change through the propose-and-challenge process described above. The
district0x team will define the initial parameter values and will stake the initial deposits
required for these parameters. The parameter set is as follows:
● Required Deposit - The number of district0x Network Tokens needed to submit an
application to the Registry.
● Challenge Period Length - The amount of time (measured in blocks) that an
application must remain idle for challenge before automatic inclusion in the
Registry.
● Voting Period Length - The amount of time (measured in blocks) that a challenge
will remain open for voting commits from token holders.
● Reveal Period Length - The amount of time (measured in blocks) during which
committed votes can be revealed for a particular challenge.
● Required Vote Share Ratio - The ratio [0 - 1] of committed AND revealed tokens in
a vote required to ​uphold​ an application’s place in the District Registry. A higher
number implies a higher bar of acceptance to the Registry.
● Awarded Ratio - The ratio [0 - 1] of forfeited deposits in a challenge that gets
rewarded to the winning depositor. A higher number is more rewarding for the
depositor, a lower number is more rewarding for voters.

13
The district0x team will affix the initial parameter set to the following values:
Required Deposit - 1,000 DNT
Challenge Period Length - 24,200 blocks (about one week)
Voting Period Length - 24,200 blocks
Reveal Period Length - 7,000 blocks (about 48 hours)
Required Vote Share Ratio - .5 (A simple majority decides to accept/reject
applications)
● Awarded Ratio - .5 (A challenger needs 66.7% confidence in success to justify a
challenge)
●
●
●
●
●

The graphic below illustrates the flow of value between network participants in the event
of a proposal being challenged and granted access to the network after a voting period.

14

district0x Network Token
To facilitate open participation and coordination across the network while providing
protections from malicious actors we introduce the district0x Network Token (DNT). The
district0x Network Token is a multi-utility ​ERC20 token​ providing holders with both
network wide governance utility and a means of gaining access to district-specific voting
rights.

Network Governance Utility
The district0x Network Token is used for interaction with the District Registry and to
govern various aspects of the district0x Network at large.
Currently, district0x Network Token holders can utilize their DNT to signal for which
districts they would like the district0x team to build and deploy next to the district0x
Network. Token holders also have the ability to signal their support or disapproval for
proposals made by network participants via the district0x Feedback Dapp.
Gradually, additional district0x Network-wide governance utility will be introduced to the
district0x Network Token, experimenting with different capabilities and allowing time for
testing and refinement before committing to permanent designs for implementation.
Before the current district0x Network roadmap will be considered complete, governance
of the network at large will be turned over entirely to district0x Network Token holders.

District-Specific Governance Utility
The district0x Network Token can be staked to deposit pools to mint tokens providing
district-specific voting rights in corresponding Aragon entities. These voting rights allow
holders to directly participate in the governance of districts on the network.
Upon staking DNT to a district’s deposit pool, participants will receive tokenized voting
rights in the respective district’s Aragon entity, which they will retain for the duration of
the time their tokens remained staked. The rate at which voting rights are dispensed will
be governed by a sliding pricing curve with the amount of DNT required to stake to mint 1
voting right increasing as a district’s deposit pool grows.

15
Participants are free to exit a district at any time, so long as they do not have votes cast
in an open vote, by un-staking their district0x Network Tokens. If a participant has cast
votes in an open vote, they are free to exit the district as soon as the voting period
closes.
Voting rights are immediately forfeited and retired upon the un-staking of DNT from a
district. After being un-staked, DNT can immediately be staked to other districts. The
frequency and duration of voting periods for a given district are defined in their
respective bylaws.
Unless specified in the bylaws of a district, there are no restrictions on the percentage of
a district’s voting rights that a participant can acquire and possess at any given time.

16

district0x Network Token Distribution
The district0x Genesis Contract minted 1,000,000,000 district0x Network Tokens.
The district0x Genesis Contract has allocated the minted district0x Network Tokens as
follows:
●
●
●
●
●
●

600,000,000 = Distributed to participants in Contribution Period v0.1
140,000,000 = Reserved for potential Contribution Period v0.2
40,000,000 = Reserved for potential Contribution Period v0.3
200,000,000 = Distributed to Founders (vest over the course of 2 years)
15,000,000 = Distributed to Advisors (vest over the course of 2 years)
5,000,000 = Distributed to Early Contributors (vest over the course of 6 months)

DNT tokens minted for allocation to founders, advisors, and early contributors are subject
to a vesting schedule. Founder and advisor tokens are allocated over a 24-month vesting
period, with a 6-month cliff. Early contributor tokens are allocated over a 6-month vesting
period, with a 3-month cliff.

Contribution Period v0.1
Contribution Period v0.1 began on July 18th, 2017 and ended on August 1st, 2017. During
this time, a total of 43,169 ETH of contributions were received. Within 24 hours of the end
of the event, 600,000,000 district0x Network Tokens were divided and distributed to the
participants.

Contribution Periods v0.2 and v0.3
A total of 180,000,000 district0x Network Tokens have been reserved to ensure the
continued efforts of the district0x Network, in the event that additional contributions are
needed to fulfill the district0x Network roadmap.
Contribution Periods v0.2 and v0.3 are subject to occur only after both the completion of
the key milestones cited on the district0x roadmap (outlined in the following section) and
18 months have passed since the previous Contribution Period. Contribution Periods v0.2
and v0.3 will not occur if additional funding is not necessary to complete the project’s
remaining roadmap items.

Projected Use of Contributions
Contributions received during Contribution Period v0.1 will be used exclusively for the
development and expansion of the district0x Network.

Development Expenses
Contributions allocated for development expenses will be utilized to cover costs
associated with the refinement of d0xINFRA, the deployment of new districts to the
district0x Network, the creation of auxiliary modules, improvements to districts
developed in-house, security audits, and the launch of the district creation platform.

Operational Expenses
Contributions allocated for operational expenses will cover any costs associated with
accounting, business development, community management, education, people
operations, recruiting, support, and any other administrative tasks.

Marketing Expenses
Contributions allocated for marketing expenses will cover any costs associated with the
promotion of the district0x Network, districts on the district0x Network, the d0xINFRA
framework, and the district0x Power Plant.

Legal Expenses
Contributions allocated for legal expenses will cover any legal costs associated with the
establishment and operation of District0x Ltd., the establishment and operation of
entities selected as service providers by the district0x Network, and any unforeseen
legal costs necessary to resolve matters that could pose a threat to the district0x
Network.

The district0x Power Plant
Inspired by the ​Slack Fund​, the district0x team will seek to establish an entity to support
the expansion of the district0x Network, advance the infrastructure upon which it is built,
foster the emergence of a developer ecosystem, and back the efforts of partner projects
that offer opportunities for interoperability.

19

Management of Contributions
As an Ethereum-based project, the long-term viability and utility of the district0x Network
is directly correlated to the continued development of the Ethereum protocol and growth
of its user base. Given such, after hedging 2 years worth of runway into a stable coin, we
intend to pay all wages to team members in ETH, to pay all possible expenses with ETH,
and to hold all idle funds in ETH in a multisig wallet indefinitely.
Understanding that the price of ETH relative to fiat currencies can be highly volatile, we
have left the door open to additional contribution periods in the event that further
funding becomes necessary for the completion of the district0x Network roadmap due to
a sustained decline in ETH/USD prices.
In the event that ETH continues to appreciate vs USD and excess contributions remain
upon the completion of the district0x Network roadmap, options will be explored to
return ETH to district0x Network Token holders.

20

Transparency Policy
As a community-centric project, we believe operational transparency is paramount. The
following steps will be taken to ensure that district0x Network Token holders will have
access to an adequate amount of information about the progression of the district0x
Network and the usage of contributions received from supporters.
