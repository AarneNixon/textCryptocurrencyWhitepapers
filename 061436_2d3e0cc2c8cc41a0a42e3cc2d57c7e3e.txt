BACKGROUND

3—

Gamification is all around us.
Each aspect of the world, from the mundane to the grand, is
being turned into a game of some sort. Uber drivers are chasing
high scores, food delivery runs are ranked with stars, and fintech
app developers are working out ways to get the same user
retention rates as Candy Crush.
Likewise, we see more of the real world being implemented into
gaming. AR games reward players for walking around the city,
CS:GO skins are fetching thousands in the steam marketplace,
and influencers design entire careers around one game.
But a lot is still missing to create a true user-driven economy
for all gamers, especially those who spend thousands of hours in
one environment and own nothing at the end of the day.
Crowns, a tokenized asset designed with the aim of rewarding
players for their time spent playing, and the Seacape Platform,
an innovative protocol designed for game developers, aims to
change all of this.
Are you ready to explore the future of incentivized gaming?

MOTIVATION

4—

A dedicated team of game developers and smart contract programmers, the Seascape team
joined the crypto community with great ambition several years ago. Filled with excitement,
development began but quickly many complications were faced. These issues tend to be faced
by most DAPP developers, which is the reason so many projects overdeliver and underperform.
These are the main problems:
LACK OF USER INCENTIVES
With the rising popularity of excellent free-to-play titles, the gaming ecosystem is full of
amazing products that anybody can play for free. The idea that any user would be willing to
educate himself about blockchain, figure out how to work a wallet, and buy cryptocurrency
before even playing a game is laughable. In order to motivate players to join a new platform,
great incentives are needed that make the gamer feel like he is really being rewarded for spent
time.
SCALABLE DEFI & NFT SOLUTIONS ARE NEEDED
The DeFi market is an untapped source of growth for the crypto industry as a whole. Powered
with the appeal of gaming, it will be unstoppable to the up and coming generation of adopters.
With less than 10 billion dollars currently locked DeFi markets, and the traditional gaming
industry grossing over 150 billion dollars on a yearly basis, the potential for growth is enormous.
Current DeFi & NFT models however cannot sustain much more than the current load, and new
solutions need to be found in order to provide an appealing platform where users can profit.
TRADITIONAL GAME PLATFORMS CHARGE TOO MUCH
With the average platform taking between 10% and 30% of all gross revenue, profits can be
seriously hurt for the majority of developers, especially as the indie game scene continues to
grow in strength. There is a real need for a game platform that allows developers to easily
publish their games with the least amount of effort possible and without charging enormous
fees. If this platform succeeds in attracting developers and also gives them the tools to deploy
their very own game chain and in turn incentivize their users, it could be quite powerful.

In this paper, we will take you through the Seascape ecosystem, which aims to solve these
issues.

The Seascape
Ecosystem
Games are going to play an increasing role in
defining the economics of the digital future,
but a game isn’t enough to create a vibrant
digital world.
In order to thrive, the Seascape ecosystem
will aim to provide a home to all game
developers and users, incentivizing them
to develop, play, and trade their assets in a
vibrant marketplace that rewards all of its
users, both with entertainment and economic
benefits.
To explain this in more detail, let’s take a
look at each moving part of the ecosystem.

DeFi Gamified
Concepts such as staking, CDPs, and yield
farming are now becoming mainstream
(at least within the crypto community).
Inherently, they are gamified aspects of
traditional finance.

Airdrops, Crowns Staking, Item CDPs, as well
as a brand-new concept: the Player Created
Coin (PCC) that clever players will be able
to implement when they want to create their
own in-game currency.

Due to their fun nature, they can easily be
implemented into games as part of core
gameplay features.

These are all ways for the players to not
only increase their in-game power, but also
earn real profits while they have fun with the
game.

BLOCKLORDS, Seascape’s flagship game,
is serving as the proof of concept for all of
these features, with examples being Title

Once this concept is perfected, it will be
scaled out to the gaming industry!

VISION

NFT Economics
While many realize the potential of NonFungible Tokens, they still haven’t reached
their full impact on the Ethereum network.
This is partly due to high gas fees and a few
technical limitations that prevent them from
reaching their true potential.
The first step in making NFTs a truly vital
part of the DeFi economy is to ensure that

they can generate earnings for their holders,
which is still only dependent on market value.
With the possibility of collateralizing NFTs to
take out debt, renting them out for set or
variable rates, and trading them on an open
exchange, the potential use cases within
BLOCKLORDS and future and future games
are endless.

Crowns
After a lot of careful consideration, Seascape
Games has unveiled a way to truly incentivize
gamers and platform users for their time
spent playing.
This method is Crowns, a token designed to
reward all key stakeholders of the gaming
ecosystem.

to experience the true power of DeFi gaming
in a fun and user-friendly way.
Various ways to stake, borrow, and utilize
Crowns will be released periodically to
players as the ecosystem grows.

Crowns will be introduced via BLOCKLORDS,
as a way to reward all players who prove
themselves worthy.
This token will be the way for most players

VISION

Paywave
Every player who owns Crowns will receive a
periodic paywave drop.
The paywave supply is taken entirely from
the spent amounts of tokens spent by users
on games hosted on the Seascape Network,
thus guaranteeing a fixed supply cap of
Crowns at 10,000,000 tokens as no inflation
takes place during this process.

This paywave function makes it easy to
create a passive way to increase amount for
all Crowns holders, and will also make the
owners stakeholders in the entire ecosystem,
further pushing the growth of its community.

Scape Store
The Scape Game Store is a user-facing
game platform based on Substrate.
Connected to the Polkadot ecosystem, the
main focus is on allowing users to own and
trade cross-chain assets while playing their
favorite games, with an option to anyone
who downloads the client to help validate
transactions and earn the Crowns token
while they play their favorite games.

Seascape. Lightpaper

By helping to keep the chain secure, users
will also be able to play an active role
in governing the game store for matters
regarding developer fees, minimum game
requirements, esports tournaments, and
much more.

Scape SDK
The Scape SDK will standardize all the moving
parts involved with releasing a game on the
Scape Store, offering clear documentation
and rules to make onboarding for users and
devs as smooth as possible.
The SDK will include native wallets that
support all major cryptocurrencies, starter
game chain kits, payment solutions,
leaderboards, and much more.

Seascape. Lightpaper

By creating an environment that attracts
gamers and developers alike, the plan is
to build a platform that will grow a strong
community and thrive over the long term.
The Scape SDK will be developed in
collaboration with established game industry
partners.

BLOCKLORDS
Arctic Seascape Studio’s first flagship
game, BLOCKLORDS has been deployed on
no less than 6 different blockchains since its
inception (ETH, TRON, NEO, LOOM, ICON,
and MATIC).

a smoother user experience that didn’t
require a wallet to get started, but could
be connected at a later date to earn crypto
incentives, was released in June 2020 and
has brought in thousands of users since its
launch.

With each iteration, the quality and scope of
the game improved as the community kept
playing and coming in with suggestions.
Throughout this process, the team learned a
lot about the pressure points game developers
faced on all these different protocols, and
this led to a number of drastic game design
decisions constantly being made.
The 2.0 version, which aimed at creating

Mobile Version
While the first version of BLOCKLORDS was
created as a web browser-based game, the
scope has now increased to include a release
on mobile platforms by early 2021.

BLOCKLORDS Mobile is currently in
development and more details will soon be
unveiled, but we can already say that it will
be packed with DeFi inspired features and
extended gameplay right at launch!

This initiative will allow us to launch a polished
game, available in a variety of languages and
with user-friendly new player tutorials right
at the get-go.

Architecture

Seascape Platform Chain
The Seascape Chain will be the native protocol
of the Scape Game Store.
Through an innovative consensus algorithm
to maximize block confirmation and TPS
speeds, local consensus will be achieved via
Crowns staking and the fact that each user
who downloads the Scape Game Store will
have the option to become a validator/collator
of the network and earn Crowns rewards while
Seascape. Lightpaper

they have their computer running.
This achieves consensus and the stability of
the platform while keeping things frictionless
for the average user who doesn’t care about all
this. By incentivizing community participants
directly, we create an environment where
everybody can monetize their time playing
games.

Binance Smart Chain
Seascape will build games on the Binance
Smart Chain (BSC), which makes use of
dual-chain architecture technology, allowing
users to access hyper fast trading, while also
making use of the smart chain’s flexibility.
Seascape will develop an SDK which will
standardize all the moving parts involved
with releasing a game on its platform, with
clear documentation and rules to make
onboarding for users and devs as smooth as
possible.

Furthermore, Seascape will offer developers
an easy way to publish their games without
the enormous fees associated with traditional
gaming platforms. The Binance Smart Chain
offers scalability in games that is unmatched,
while also remaining connected to the value
and liquidity of Ethereum, which in turn will
empower the users to decide where and how
they want to buy or sell their gamified DeFi
assets.

ICE Viaduct
The viaduct serves as the Seascape
platform’s connection to the outside world.
It will be able to connect to a variety of
Polkadot parachains, as well other established
protocols such as Ethereum, Algorand, and
more.

By letting our games and the store platform
work as a hub connected to the entire
decentralized economy, we do not lock users
in and allow them to migrate their assets
however they wish.

Slot Bid
Scape users who lock DOTS in their platform
wallet will receive increased Crowns rewards,
subsidized on-chain transactions, share of
profit from the games, and access to all
Scape games for free or discounted prices.

If Parachain bid requirements cannot be met,
the Seascape Chain will be built on Kusama,
as well as an independently functioning chain
with its own bridges, to ensure connection
with the entire decentralized economy
regardless of outside conditions.

This will allow Seascape to stay competitive
in the Parachain bids, thus ensuring the
stability and scalability of the ecosystem.

Platform Fees
A new kind of fee model will let users and
developer choose between paying fees
monthly (partial validation) or for each
transaction (full validation).
These fees can be paid entirely in Crowns
and will be much lower than existing
solutions.
This will also enable game developers

to join a monthly subscription program
where their games are offered as part
of the monthly subscription plan, thus
guaranteeing a stable recurring revenue
for developers.
This system also allows the Scape developer
share of the revenue to be much lower than
existing game client platforms such as the
Steam and Apple stores.

Game Chains
Any game released on the Seascape
Platform will have the option to create their
own blockchain with its own set of rules.
These chains can either run on Crowns
economics or create their token backed
by Crowns or any other established
cryptocurrency.
Seascape. Lightpaper

Running their own chain will enable game
developers to set their own rules depending
on their exact needs, keeping them free to
experiment with decentralized economics
and game features as they wish.

Looking Ahead
The intent with BLOCKLORDS, Crowns,
and the Seascape Platform Chain are
one and the same; to reward players and
developers for their contributions to any
given game.

on improving our game titles, releasing
new ones, and forging partnerships with
other studios, meanwhile developing
and improving our client and launcher
solutions.

By continuing our focus and dedicating
ourselves to the task of making games
and their economies more accessible to
everyone, we will stick to our core values
and continue development at a steady
pace.

This steady pace of development, along
with our excellent track record is the key
to delivering a high-quality product in a
limited amount of time. We haven’t, and
will not, let our fans down!

We believe firmly that before a game
store can be commercially viable, it needs
to be based around an excellent library of
games, so we take the short term to work
