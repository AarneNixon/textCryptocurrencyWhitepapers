Sologenic Ecosystem
Tokenize, Trade, Earn & Spend
Sologenic is introducing a sophisticated ecosystem that facilitates users with investing,
trading, and on-demand tokenization of assets such as stocks, ETFs, and fiat on top of
the XRP Ledger. A tokenized stablecoin of TSLA stock or USD fiat is presented as TSLAƨ
or USDƨ, respectively. These stablecoins are tradable and redeemable against XRP and
SOLO on both CoinField exchange & XRPL DEX.
There are two types of tokens available within the Sologenic ecosystem:
●
●

SOLO Coin:​ A utility Token which is listed on global crypto exchanges.
Tokenized Assets:​ Securities Stablecoins backed by Fiat or Stocks which are only
available to trade on Sologenic due to required securities brokerage licenses.

Abstract
Since its launch in April 2018, CoinField Exchange has been growing daily and has expanded
its operations rapidly across all continents around the globe.
In this paper, CoinField reveals full details of the Sologenic ecosystem that strives to build a
modern, fast, and secure platform to enable billions of people to tokenize different
non-blockchain based assets such as stocks and ETFs from over 25 different global stock
exchanges and trade them against cryptocurrencies in a straightforward platform.
Sologenic deploys SOLO coins for market-making and liquidity providing. SOLO coins and
subsequent stablecoins are issued on the XRP Ledger allowing liquidity to be moved almost
instantly. This creates a dynamic bridge between crypto assets and non-blockchain-based
assets by being paired directly with fiat as a collateral to settle with third-party brokerage
firms.
SOLO coins are available for trading on the XRPL DEX and other major global crypto
exchanges. SOLO holders can take advantage of the SOLO Cards to convert their assets

Sologenic Ecosystem
Redefining Asset Trading
The Blockchain and its related technologies are paving the foundation for our self-sovereign
digital lives. With the advent of these technologies and the development of some of its
prominent protocols such as the XRP Ledger, traditional financial markets and their
transactions will soon become obsolete.
One of the most profound and bold use cases in the Blockchain space is the financial
technology (FinTech) industry. By utilizing Blockchain technology, financial transactions
become fast, secure, and transparent. Blockchain technology provides an immutable ledger
for storing these transactions, thereby preventing any manipulation or tampering of
financial records.
The growing mainstream adoption and popularity of cryptocurrencies have garnered
investor interest. Institutional, as well as retail investors, are exhibiting more significant
interest in cryptocurrencies, who consider them to be a new asset class.
Sologenic is a sophisticated ecosystem that facilitates the process of on-demand, secure
and low-cost tokenization of non-Blockchain based assets on the XRP Ledger. The
Sologenic ecosystem essentially acts as a bridge between Blockchain and other asset
classes such as stocks and ETFs.
Tokenized assets are tradable against Sologenic's native coin, SOLO and XRP. SOLO coins
can be traded against cryptocurrencies as the tokens act as a market maker and liquidity
provider.
Sologenic intends to offer discounts on trading fees, along with the Liquidity Provider
Reward Program (LPRP) for SOLO holders. Additionally, Sologenic users receive a FREE
crypto card for everyday purchases and transactions around the globe.
The ecosystem aims to eliminate entry barriers for individual and institutional crypto
investors, allowing them to trade non-blockchain asset classes with one single
cryptocurrency - SOLO.
Sologenic reduces the cost, friction, and complexity of traditional trading and transferring of
assets by creating a simple, fast, and secure infrastructure tailored for the modern era.
Users receive exceptional benefits such as trading discounts, crypto cards, and our
Liquidity Provider Reward Program (LPRP).

Market Consideration
State of the Industry
Diversification is one of the critical strategies investors employ to minimize investment
risks. Retail and institutional investors strive to diversify their portfolio by spreading the
capital among various asset classes. Traditionally, investors considered stocks and bonds
as the most liquid financial instruments and the go-to choice for building a diversified
portfolio with an optimal risk profile. Although these asset classes are substantial vehicles
for building wealth and economic opportunities for the society, they can be unattainable for
people residing in emerging economies, where capital markets are not sufficiently
developed, regulated, or efficient.
For example, if Tesla Inc. (TSLA) stock is not traded on overseas marketplaces, such as
Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) or Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), it becomes nearly
impossible for people living in those regions to purchase this asset.
The traditional trading systems indirectly prevent billions of people from participating in
global capital markets and slow down the economic growth in emerging economies.
The world's financial infrastructures are highly advanced, but some regions are extremely
saturated like North America and Western Europe. To illustrate this point, Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) has estimated the US accounts for 38%
and 39% of global equities and bond markets, respectively [1].

11

Asset Classes
There is a wide range of asset classes that investors can choose from to achieve a desired
rate of return.
The common perception among investors is to rely on real-estate, stocks, and bond
investments to increase their standard of living and provide economic security.
Interestingly enough, these conventional asset classes interlinked together through the
unregulated housing market, mortgage-backed securities, and REIT funds, which brought
the entire financial system to the brink of failure.
The financial crisis of 2008 suggests that investing is not so simple, and systemic risks may
occur. Certain economic events can wipe out as much as 50% of the portfolio value within a
year, bringing panic and chaos into the economy.

The global derivatives market has increased dramatically over the last 20 years; beginning
with just under $100 trillion in 1999 and now reaching an almost $545 trillion market value
[2].

12

Each financial asset has its unique characteristics. The trading, risk profile, and mode of
acquisition of individual assets vary from other financial instruments. For instance, the
nature and behavior of fiat currencies are different from real estate or traditional financial
markets. When an individual wants to add stocks to his portfolio, he must exchange his fiat
money with the desired shares from another seller. This entire process must go through a
third-party broker that mediates and oversees this transaction. The broker is responsible
for verifying the authenticity of the transaction and the legitimacy of the traded assets. In
short, both the parties must trust this mediator or broker to process the transaction.
While cryptocurrencies represent a class of assets that hold a specific value in their
respective markets, converting fiat to cryptocurrencies requires a third-party service
similar to the conventional brokerage. Unlike traditional asset transactions, cryptocurrency
trading does not require a trusted third-party as blockchain transactions are executed
using cryptographic functions and subject to the on-chain rules. For example, a user can
sell bitcoin (BTC) to buy ethereum (ETH) by simply connecting to the decentralized
exchange that facilitates the transaction flow on a blockchain.

A Shift in Institutional Portfolios
Financial institutions like banks, pension funds, and insurance companies with massive
stakes in capital markets, are gradually adjusting their positions. It appears that during 2018,
ETFs funds grew by $238.4 billion to a total market value of $3.4 trillion while mutual funds
shrank by $91.3 billion, and now account for a total market value of $16.3 trillion [3]. In
comparison to retail investors, institutional fund managers have large positions in
derivatives markets for the purposes of risk-management and speculation. Financial
institutions also have greater exposure to residential and commercial real estate markets.
According to the 2019 report from Black Rock, the figures suggest that institutional money
moved away from stocks into more stable assets, such as bonds and real estate [4]. Also,
the collective sentiment indicates that corporate players increased portfolio exposure to
private equity (+37%), real estate assets (+50%), and cash (+4%) amid a slowdown in
economic growth. According to this trend, it appears that institutional investors plan on
diversifying by increasing stakes in other asset classes.

13

Challenges in the Traditional Asset Trading
Industry
Regional Economic Markets
Despite the technological development in the US, Canada, the UK, the EU, or Asia - the
existing economic infrastructures do not support value exchange on a cross-border scale.
An investor in Canada must go through multiple brokerages to invest in a particular stock in
China or Japan. Furthermore, to make direct investments in a foreign market, the investor
must be accredited or invest a certain amount of capital in qualifying for direct access to
certain assets. The regional nature of economic markets prevents small investors from
acquiring global assets.

Limited Access to Global Assets
Billions of people in emerging economies cannot access essential financial services to
participate in capital markets or engage in global commerce. Geopolitical uncertainty,
financial literacy, low levels of income, high-cost of intermediary, and lack of trust in
financial institutions are the major factors contributing to this outcome.
Traditional firms are not economically motivated to offer services in countries that have low
levels of disposable income. For instance, large investment banks are not interested in
serving the underdeveloped markets since populations can hardly afford to absorb the
monthly fees for keeping a small chequing account.

No Technology for Cross-Asset Trading
One of the primary reasons behind the slow adoption of crypto assets among regular
investors is the lack of underlying financial infrastructure. The existing trading systems are
limited to a specific set of assets, such as stocks and ETFs. These trading platforms lack the
technology necessary for facilitating cross-asset trading. A trader is unable to exchange
cryptocurrencies to other traditional financial instruments. Additionally, the development of
the crypto infrastructure has focused on particular regions, with very few global venues for
international investors.

14

Tokenization
The conventional securitization process gets transformed through the use of blockchain
technology, which maintains the benefits while addressing the core issues associated with
the lack of transparency and the risk of defaults. Central issuers can act as custodians of
the assets and issue digital tokens that are designed to replicate market behavior of stocks,
bonds, currencies, and commodities.
By employing tokenization, investments can be made using alternative assets. Examples
include commercial real-estate, antique art, cryptocurrency baskets, and business projects
to the general public. Under such a system, each digital token represents an ownership
stake in the underlying asset and provides direct control to the end-user. In short, each
token holder has the liberty to access and trade digital tokens on global markets that
operate 24/7 throughout the year in a decentralized exchange setting.
In combination with smart-contract technology, Blockchain can provide transparency over
the entire tokenization process. Removing third-parties that are responsible for buying,
securitizing, and selling assets to the public.
Investors can tokenize or burn any assets on-demand and trade them with other assets
without additional overhead and points-of-failure within a system.
Tokenization helps:
●
●
●
●

Unlock the economic value of assets
Create a global market for assets
Remove multiple intermediaries
Fast and secure transfer of assets

Sologenic Ecosystem
Introduction
The Sologenic ecosystem and it's SOLO coin provides a one-stop solution to tokenizing
assets. Assets such as stocks and ETFs can be traded on over 25 different global stock
exchanges against cryptocurrencies.
The Sologenic ecosystem aims to make it effortless for crypto investors to exchange assets
and invest in different types of traditional financial instruments. These financial operations
require a robust underlying infrastructure that operates in real-time and provides fast,
secure, and transparent transactions.
Current financial gateways such as VISA have been striving to make it faster for users to
transact with an average of 65,000 transactions per second [5]. The changing business
landscape and financial requirements of investors demand a swift, global financial
infrastructure.
With the invention of Bitcoin, other decentralized protocols for exchanging value came into
existence such as the Ethereum network and XRP Ledger. These blockchain protocols have
been around since the early days of Bitcoin and dedicated significant time and resources to
building a more scalable blockchain infrastructure. Although each blockchain protocol
differs from the other and designed for specific use cases, they effectively address
different problems.
Building on top of an existing blockchain is desirable as it allows the development team to
focus on the functionalities of the ecosystem rather than underlying technology such as the
consensus mechanism, immutability, and mining.

XRP Ledger (XRPL)
The XRP Ledger is a decentralized cryptographic ledger powered by a network of
peer-to-peer servers [6]. The company behind the core development of the XRPL is
"Ripple", which also integrates XRP as a native token in their ecosystem. Ripple believes in
making "a world in which money moves the way information does today. [7]"

16

Why the XRP ledger (XRPL)
Today, many Blockchain technologies exist, offering niches and uniqueness in many
different aspects. When we created the technical requirements of this project, it became
self-evident that XRP Ledger is, in fact, is the most scalable blockchain that offers the
technologies and tools required to build the Sologenic ecosystem. After all, we think XRP is
built to cater to this exact system for the following reasons:.
●

Censorship-Resistant Transaction Processing
No single party decides which XRP transactions succeed or fail, and no one can
"rollback" a transaction after it completes. As long as those who choose to
participate in the network keep it healthy, they can send and receive XRP in seconds.

●

Fast & Efficient Consensus Algorithm
The XRP Ledger's consensus algorithm settles transactions in 4 to 5 seconds,
processing at a throughput of up to 1,500 transactions per second.

●

Responsible Software Governance
A team of full-time, world-class developers at Ripple maintains and continually
improves the XRP Ledger's underlying software. Ripple acts as a steward for the
technology and an advocate for its interests and builds constructive relationships
with governments and financial institutions worldwide.

●

Secure, Adaptable Cryptography
The XRP Ledger relies on industry-standard digital signature systems like ECDSA
(the same scheme used by Bitcoin) but also supports modern, efficient algorithms
like Ed25519. The extensible nature of the XRP Ledger's software makes it possible to
add and disable algorithms as state of the art in cryptography advances.

●

Modern Features for Smart Contracts
Features like Escrow, Checks, and Payment Channels support cutting-edge financial
applications, including the Interledger Protocol. This toolbox of advanced features
comes with safety features like a process for amending the network and separate
checks against invariant constraints.

●

On-Ledger Decentralized Exchange
The XRP Ledger also has a fully-functional accounting system for tracking and
trading obligations denominated in any way users want, and an exchange built into
the protocol. The XRP Ledger can settle long, cross-currency payment paths and
exchanges of multiple currencies in atomic transactions, bridging gaps of trust with
XRP.

It is crucial to understand that Ripple is working with more than 200 financial institutions
from 40 different countries, which is a clear indicator of its growing prowess in the
payments industry. Some of the leading global financial institutions, such as American
Express, PNC, SBI (SBI Remit), and Moneygram, are using Ripple’s payment network,
RippleNet, for international transactions.
17

Architecture
Sologenic ecosystem consists of five main components that together facilitate the process
of on-demand tokenization of non-blockchain based assets and trading against
cryptocurrencies. These components are CoinField Platform, Brokerage Gateway, XRPL
Native DEX, XRP Ledger, and the Open SDK suite.

CoinField Role
The CoinField platform is used to connect all components. The first step for users is to
create accounts and undergo KYC/AML verifications.

18

Once approved, users can make either fiat deposits or crypto deposits into their newly
created wallets hosted on CoinField's secure infrastructure. Users can deposit funds from a
wide range of fiat or crypto options.

When funds are deposited, users can convert these assets directly to SOLO coins. SOLO is
the only coin able to be converted to tokenized non-blockchain based assets.
The process of buying these assets happens at the CoinField's proprietary gateway where
the user's SOLO is liquidated to fiat in real-time, to be used as liquidity to settle with the
stock brokerage firms.

Conversion automatically takes place at one of CoinField’s existing markets where the
user’s asset paired with SOLO coin e.g., SOLO/USD.
19

Using SOLO as the sole liquidity to settle with the brokerage house has many advantages,
such as:
●
●
●

Unifying the liquidity pool to be used for settlements
Allowing SOLO holders to participate in the liquidity pool and take benefits through
Liquidity Provider Reward Program (LPRP).
An increased trade volume of SOLO across different markets.

Sologenic uses external brokerage companies to buy and sell different types of assets, such
as Stocks.

Brokerage Gateway
Sologenic works with top brokerage firms to facilitate the process of buying and selling
different stocks from over 25 global stock exchanges.
By using third-party FIX APIs provided by the brokerage firm, it ensures that tokenization or
burning on the XRP Ledger can happen immediately after the trade is complete.

Tokenization & the XRP Ledger
CoinField's Gateway connects to the XRP Ledger via existing rippled nodes in place on the
platform. Each corresponding tokenized asset has an XRP address on the XRP Ledger that
has an established TrustLine to the main SOLO issuing Gateway on the XRPL.

Upon successful callback from the third-party API, the system issues the corresponding
currency from the main SOLO gateway to the XRP address that belongs to the issued asset.

20

Sample ​pseudo-transaction to be sent on the XRP ledger​:

Asset-backed token’s XRP addresses are in HEX format and are made public for users to
view and confirm the transactions. A mapping of HEX addresses to their corresponding
currencies are also publish via a feed.

ƨ​

Once tokenized, the asset issued on the XRP Ledger is denominated with the suffix of “​ ”
(e.g. AAPL​Ƨ​, TSLA​Ƨ, ​USD​Ƨ​). In the meantime, CoinField’s internal ledger is connected to a
rippled node to scan the recent transactions and adjust the user balances accordingly.
At this point, the user can hold their assets on CoinField or withdraw to another exchange
that has integrated their system with Sologenic’s proposed SDK to allow for deposits and
withdrawals to take place or to XRP Ledger’s native decentralized exchange.

Stablecoin Assets
Tokenized assets are Stablecoins in nature and pegged to the real value of the
non-blockchain based assets. They are redeemable via CoinField’s centralized platform or
traded on Sologenic’s XRPL Decentralized Exchange against XRP and SOLO. This means
tokenized asset holders are free to independently redeem their assets for XRP and SOLO in
the Decentralized Exchange regardless of the status of the Brokerage Gateway.
The value stabilized tokens remain by the real value of the assets due to arbitrage
opportunities for market makers and the fact that CoinField’s Gateway always redeems at
the current market prices outside of the Blockchain network.
The Gateway follows the rules of external markets to make sure transactions always go
through and without devaluation or inflation.
When a stock is being tokenized or burned, the Gateway only accepts the transaction
during the hours of operation of the specific stock exchange.

21

An example of trading assets and tokenization could be for TSLA shares, where trading can
only happen during the market hours of 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM EST Monday through Friday).

Integration and Open SDK suite
As part of mass adoption strategies with Sologenic and integration with other exchanges
including DEX, Sologenic plans to release a suite of open-source software development
toolkits that makes it possible to seamlessly integrate the process of transferring tokenized
assets and SOLO coins to and from XRP addresses. Users are free to withdraw their
tokenized assets and trade them on Sologenic’s decentralized exchange, XRP’s native DEX.
Sologenic highly encourages the developer community to contribute to developing these
toolkits.
Sologenic is open to community recommendations/involvement for the development of
SDKs and APIs and decentralization of these services through projects such as Codius and
Interledger by providing the necessary tools and sandboxes to create such systems.
Besides community efforts, the core developers of Sologenic are researching and
developing these systems on an ongoing basis.
Sologenic strongly supports the community and businesses to use the Interledger protocol
to run connector nodes to act as an intermediary for transfers of micropayments across
wallets and exchanges.

Custody & Proof of Solvency
As the world of blockchain permeates our financial institutions, it becomes critical to verify
the legitimacy of relationships, such as confirming the relationship of a tokenized asset to a
real-world asset held in a trust. To be transparent, Sologenic exposes an endpoint that
allows for the public to view the inventory of real-world assets fetched via the third-party
APIs and their corresponding digitized asset on the XRP Ledger.
In addition to providing a public section to view assets and liabilities via the platform,
Sologenic plans to conduct third party audits that would certify the authenticity of the
assets.

Transactions
All transactions, including issuing, burning, and transfers, are executed on the XRP
Ledger, and the current XRP transaction fees applies.
CoinField uses the same Open SDK that is developed to handle transactions on the
XRPL.
22

Products in Development
Sologenic Decentralized Exchange
One of the major products to be added into the Sologenic ecosystem is Decentralized
Exchange, built on top of XRP Ledger’s fully-functional decentralized exchange where users
can trade issued tokenized assets for SOLO or XRP. Sologenic is building a simple, intuitive,
and powerful UI with the same development standards as used within CoinField Centralized
Exchange.
Features of Sologenic Decentralized Exchange include:
●

Sologenic DEX users will host private keys:
The users of Sologdnic’s DEX holds the private keys of their wallets, providing them
complete ownership/authority over their crypto assets. It facilitates swift
transactions, quick settlements, and improved security of a user’s cryptocurrencies.

●

Major platform for SOLO trading:
Sologenic DEX is a significant platform for the trading of SOLO coins & tokenized
non-blockchain assets. CoinField’s centralized exchange plays a crucial role in
market making for SOLO coins and provides sufficient liquidity to third-party
exchanges facilitating the trading of SOLO coins.

●

Development and market-making of Sologenic DEX:
CoinField uses its real experience in running a successful cryptocurrency exchange
for the development of Sologenic DEX.

The transaction fees and trading charges generated from the financial activity on Sologenic
DEX is used to reward liquidity pool providers.
●

Eliminating a single point of failure:
One of the primary challenges in front of the crypto trading community and
investors is safeguarding assets. Cryptocurrencies are designed with built-in
protection, through encryption and consensus protocols, from cyberattacks or
malicious transactions. The distributed nature of blockchain, the underlying
technology of crypto assets, prevents any single point of failure within its network.
However, since centralized exchanges store user data, trading activity, and
transactions on traditional servers, they’re vulnerable to cyber attacks.

Sologenic’s decentralized exchange uses the XRPL distributed ledger, protecting any
exploitation. The distributed nature of the exchange and the presence of multiple validator
nodes, including the ones run by CoinField, ensures regular operation even if a handful of
nodes are compromised.

●

Ownership of private keys:
Sologenic’s decentralized exchange is committed to providing the ownership of
crypto assets to its holders through the ownership of private keys. It is critical to
understand that a crypto investor or owner has complete ownership of his/her
cryptocurrencies only if he/she controls the private keys. It ensures that in case of a
shutdown of the exchange, the investor still owns/controls his cryptocurrencies.
Additionally, it prevents any impact of exchange-level security breaches on crypto
owners.

Tokenized Assets Trading
The world of finance is ripe for technological transformation. Through tokenization, the
industry can achieve interconnected markets and global 24/7 liquidity. SOLO holders have
access to a wide range of stocks from over 25 global stock exchanges. This infrastructure
connects the legacy financial systems with blockchain-based assets and enables new
markets, allowing cryptocurrency trading for the other asset classes.

SOLO Credit Card
SOLO holders can be eligible to obtain a FREE Crypto Card to spend their cryptos instantly
anywhere in the world. SOLO holders have various benefits on the Crypto cards, such as
Monthly Rebate Cash Back, Airport Lounge Access, Discount on Select Hotels and Private
events.

Burn Mechanism
100% of the transaction fees generated through transfers and decentralized trading will be
burned instantly by being sent to the gateway’s issuing address (Black hole). The system
practices this deflationary mechanism to bring down the total supply of SOLO coins which
in turn makes remaining SOLO coins more valuable. This practice makes an equilibrium that
in the long term makes it impossible for the SOLO coins to deplete due to higher valuation
of coins and lower supply.

distributions are dedicated to Initial Investors, VIP private sale, and IEO. Funds raised in all
rounds of token sales are used primarily for R&D, product development, marketing, legal,
licensing, and strategic partnerships. Additionally any portion of allocated VIP Pre-Sale or
IEO tokens which are not sold will be added to SOLO Liquidity & Operation Fund.

Incentives & Benefits for Platform Users
Sologenic Users:
The Liquidity Provider Reward Program (LPRP)
The Sologenic ecosystem rewards its users for their participation in providing liquidity for
transactions. The ecosystem provides multiple participation avenues for its users, including
the Sologenic liquidity pool, CoinField DEX, and CoinField centralized exchange.

29

Transfer and Transaction Fees on DEX
Transferring SOLO in and out of XRP wallets incur a transaction fee in XRP Drops (network
fees differ depending on the network load and other factors, but currently is at 10 drops)
and a burn amount of 0.01% charged to the sender of the transaction. The system practices
this deflationary burn mechanism to bring down the total supply of SOLO coins which in
turn makes remaining SOLO coins more valuable.
The sender of any payment is debited an extra 0.01% based on the size of the transaction.
The recipient of the payment receives a credit for the intended amount.
This process also applies to trades on the DEX where the seller is charged an extra fee of
0.01% while the buyer receives the amount disclosed on the original order volume meaning
the seller/sender of the transaction must take into account the extra fee for the
payment/order to go through.
This burn mechanism makes an equilibrium that in the long term makes it impossible for the
SOLO coins to deplete due to higher valuation of coins and lower supply.

Liquidity Provider Reward Program (LPRP) on CoinField
Centralized Exchange
SOLO holders can voluntarily participate in the Liquidity Provider Reward Program (LPRP),
receive rewards of up to ​20% annually​. CoinField launch multiple time-based programs,
with both weekly or monthly participation models. Some of these programs come with

Value Proposition for Sologenic Community
SOLO Community Fund (SCF)
The purpose of the Sologenic Community Fund “SCF” is to help the blockchain &
cryptocurrency ecosystem grow globally by supporting various projects from the
community. Sologenic is committed to building the infrastructure required for the
large-scale adoption of cryptocurrencies. SCF is used for funding decentralized
community-based projects, community events and emergency situations.

Community Participation Program
Sologenic deploys a specific algorithm to analyze the community feedback in different
events such as SCF, allowing SOLO holders to participate in the selection process. The
selected projects receive funding and guidance in the development and management from
the Sologenic team and the community.
The community participation weight of a SOLO holder depends on the number of SOLO
coins they hold. For example, community participation from a user with 100 SOLO coins is
considered as 100 points in an event, whereas community participation from a user with 1
SOLO coin considered with the weight of 1 towards the calculation.
Community participation takes place on CoinField’s platform, and results are public for
anyone to audit, which prevents the users’ private information from being obfuscated in the
results section.
