GENERAL INFORMATION
This whitepaper describes the initial sale in which the QUOINE LIQUID TOKEN (QASH) is sold. QASH is a crypto token that
is designed to be used for all services provided by the LIQUID PLATFORM and QUOINE’s existing exchange platforms as
explained in this whitepaper. QASH also can be used as a Crypto Token to pay for any other services provided by other
business entities. QUOINE will generally not limit the usage of QASH or the types of business entities that would like to use
QASH for their business.
QASH is not intended to constitute a security in any jurisdiction. This white paper is not a solicitation for investment and does
not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction.
Please note that purchases of QASH are final and non-refundable.
Individuals, businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring QASH.
LIMITATION OF THE PURCHASERS
You are not eligible to and you shall not purchase QASH through its token sale if you are a citizen or resident (tax or otherwise)
of any country or state where the purchase of QASH or similar Crypto Token may be prohibited or the token sale is deemed to
be not compliant with the applicable laws and regulations. In particular, if you are a resident of People’s Republic of China, you
cannot purchase QASH through the token sale.
Purchases of QASH should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with,
and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of Crypto Tokens and blockchain based software systems. Purchasers should
have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other Crypto Tokens. Any entities
of QUOINE and officers and employees thereof will not be responsible in any way for loss of any Crypto Tokens, QASH or
fiat currency resulting from actions taken by, or omissions of the purchasers. If you do not have the required experience or
expertise, then you should not purchase QASH or participate in the sale of QASH.
You should carefully consider the risks, costs, and any other demerits of acquiring QASH, and, if necessary, obtain your own
independent advice in this regard. If you are not in the position to accept nor to understand the risks associated with the token
sale of QASH (including the risks related to the non-development of LIQUID PLATFORM) or any other risks as indicated in this
whitepaper, you should not acquire QASH, until such that you have received the necessary independent advice.
RISKS
The purchase of QASH carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing QASH, the purchaser should carefully consider the
risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professional prior to determining
whether to purchase QASH.
(a) QASH will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by the purchaser. If a
purchaser of QASH does not maintain an accurate record of their password, this may lead to the loss of QASH.
If your password protection is weak and it is cracked or learned by somebody else, this may also lead to the loss
of QASH. As a result, purchasers must safely store their password in one or more backup locations that are well
separated from the primary location.
(b) The purchaser recognizes that some of the services under the LIQUID PLATFORM is currently under
development and may undergo significant changes before release. The purchaser acknowledges that any of its
expectations regarding the form and functionality of the LIQUID PLATFORM may not be met for any number of
reasons.

(c) The purchaser understands that while QUOINE will make best efforts to connect the LIQUID PLATFORM to
most of the major Crypto exchanges around, it is possible that some exchanges may decline the connection
with the LIQUID PLATFORM, which may result in the less liquidity provided through the LIQUID PLATFORM than
expected in this whitepaper.
(d) The purchaser understands that while QUOINE will make best efforts to release the LIQUID PLATFORM on
time, it is possible that the official release may be delayed.
(e) As with other Crypto Tokens, value of QASH may fluctuate significantly and become reduced in value for any
number of reasons, including but not limited to, supply and demand, overall Crypto Tokens’ market conditions,
political or geographical reasons, changes of regulations in any jurisdictions, and technical reasons.
(f) QASH will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, any malfunction or unexpected functioning of the
Ethereum protocol may impact the purchaser’s ability to transfer or securely hold QASH. Such impact could
adversely affect the value of QASH.
DISCLAIMER
To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable laws, regulations and rules, QASH, any entities of QUOINE and officers
and employees thereof shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other losses of any kind, in tort,
contract or otherwise (including but not limited to loss of revenue, income or profits, and loss of use or data), arising out of or
in connection with any acceptance of or reliance on this whitepaper or any part thereof by you.
Any entities of QUOINE and officers and employees thereof shall not be liable for your loss of QASH after it is transferred to you
by any reason including but not limited to your failure to maintain or backup an accurate record of your password or password
cracking by somebody due to your poor maintenance of your password.
QUOINE will do its best to launch its operations and develop LIQUID PLATFORM. Any person undertaking to acquire QASH
acknowledges and understands however that QUOINE does not provide with any warranty as to the release of the LIQUID
PLATFORM. They acknowledge and understand therefore that QUOINE (incl. its bodies and employees) assumes no liability or
responsibility for any loss or damage that would result from or relate to the incapacity to use the QASH.
Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing businesses and operations associated to Crypto Tokens in the world. In
that respect, regulatory measures, investigations or actions may impact QUOINE’s business and may limit or prevent it from
developing its operations in the future. Any person undertaking to acquire QASH must be aware that QUOINE’s business model
or LIQUID PLATFORM and its existing platforms may change or need to be modified because of new regulatory and compliance
requirements from any applicable laws in any jurisdictions. In such case, purchasers and any person undertaking to acquire
QASH acknowledge and understand that neither QUOINE nor any of its affiliate shall be held liable for any direct or indirect
loss or damages caused by such changes.
This whitepaper and any other materials or explanations made by QUOINE and its officers and employees shall not and cannot
be considered as an invitation to enter into an investment. They do not constitute or relate in any way nor should they be
considered as an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. This whitepaper does not include nor contain any information or
indication that might be considered as a recommendation or that might be used as a basis for any investment decision.
Neither QUOINE nor any of its officers and employees are to be or shall be considered as advisor in any legal, tax or financial
matters.
Acquiring QASH shall not grant any right or influence over QUOINE’s organization and governance to the purchasers.

NO REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
QUOINE does not make or purport to make, and hereby disclaims, any representation, warranty or undertaking in any form
whatsoever to any entity or person, including any representation, warranty or undertaking in relation to the truth, accuracy and

Abstract

QUOINE LIQUID PLATFORM is a single globally-sourced trading platform (World Book)
with an associated suite of services (Prime Brokerage). Combined, these produce the
highest level of liquidity in the world—allowing any individual to access the opportunities
and wealth the new Crypto economy offers.
The LIQUID Platform’s World Book is built on top of QUOINE’s existing Matching
Engine, Smart Order Routing, and Cross Currency Conversion Engine technologies. It
becomes the ultimate resource for traders—a multi-market order book that combines
every liquidity source in the world into a single highly liquid tradable order book, in
any currency a user chooses.
The LIQUID Platform’s Prime Brokerage offers Direct Market Access (DMA), Fiat
Management, Crypto/Fiat Credit facility, and Real Time Reporting.
Serving all client sizes and requirements: The LIQUID Platform combines it’s World
Book and Prime Brokerage with high-end services such as System Co-Location,
Automated Trading Strategies, “Crowd-Sourced” AI-driven Algorithms, and QUOINE’s
advanced proprietary Trading Tools.
A universal native Token: the QUOINE LIQUID TOKEN, QASH is the fuel that will power
all services QUOINE provides. We are already in talks with financial institutions and
partners to make QASH the preferred Token for their own upcoming and existing
financial services, as they migrate to decentralized platforms. We envision QASH will
be used in the broader financial industry and any other industries for various purposes
including payment and remittance.
The end goal: QUOINE is building a solid, global financial utility—an advanced platform
the entire Crypto economy will use to great advantage; where anyone can participate
as users and Token holders.
QUOINE LIQUID will become a complete financial ecosystem for the Crypto
economy.

Background

11

When Bitcoin appeared in 2009, only a few visionaries understood a disruptive shock
wave was about to hit the Financial industry. Like the Gutenberg Press and the Internet,
it promises to take power and information control away from an elite class, and distribute
it among individuals.
In just eight years, Bitcoin has gone from a market cap of zero to $70 billion. There are
twelve other Crypto Tokens with ten-figure market caps. The market cap of all Crypto
Token combined stands at over $140 billion—with the surrounding infrastructure and
ecosystem likely worth a lot more.

Let’s look at a few key statistics. The global (fiat) FX market
processes $5–6 trillion in trades per day. Cryptocurrency’s
daily share is relatively smaller (for now) at around
$2 billion—although it sometimes reaches $4–6 billion.
While there are 172 unique fiat currencies in the world,
there are 1097 Crypto Tokens, and counting. When we
look at these figures, they indicate that the crypto-market
is going to continue an upward trend.

Most Crypto Token value so far has come from speculation and trading. Everyone who
came late to the party is searching for the “next Bitcoin”. Almost every day, a new Crypto
Token comes to market to seek its fortune on hundreds of exchanges worldwide, and
thousands more will follow.
Millions of individuals, thousands of businesses, and even new industries will emerge—
building their entire foundations on these decentralized Crypto Token based ecosystems.
From ordinary payments to huge institutional transfers, fundraising and investments,
smart contracts and services that haven’t even been dreamt up yet—disruption is now
coming from all directions.
The new Crypto economy is here. The future of finance is distributed.
Democratization of finance has begun. The power is now in everyone’s hands.
12

Enter QUOINE. A successful and profitable cryptocurrency firm with an impeccable
reputation and financial industry pedigree. As of 29th September 2017, we are the first
global cryptocurrency firm in the world to be officially licensed by the Japan FSA (License
0002): http://www.fsa.go.jp/menkyo/menkyoj/kasoutuka.pdf. Our QUOINEX and
QRYPTOS trading platforms are the most advanced in the world with annual transactions
over $12 Billion. With over two and a half centuries of combined experience in finance
and financial technology, QUOINE’s team understands the industry inside out. In fact,
we understand it enough to know legacy finance is becoming obsolete. Large financial
institutions simply cannot keep up with innovation. And we’re only just beginning—read
on to see how we plan to grow this exponentially, and why our people are the ones to
deliver.
THE LIQUIDITY PROBLEM
Amid the massive, often chaotic ocean of economic activity in the Crypto Token markets,
participants face many challenges. At QUOINE, we have identified ONE fundamental
element to address. It’s an element so large it often gets overlooked... yet it’s vital to
the health and growth of the worldwide Crypto economy. That element is: LIQUIDITY.
Liquidity is the lifeblood of any industry, any economy and any individual business.
Liquidity covers short-term obligations and working capital needs of businesses—
whether it’s associated with debt financing or funding of new initiatives. A company
can have the largest asset base in the world and the best-run business, BUT if at any
point in time it needs short term-finance, and is unable to lend against or liquidate any
of its assets, then that company is in trouble. Financial world history is littered with such
casualties. Its future doesn’t need to be. Liquidity problems triggered many of the Global
Financial Crisis’ most traumatic events. Its first major shock occurred when BNP Paribas
suspended liquidation from three of its money market funds, citing illiquid markets. Then
there were runs on Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, leading to their eventual collapse.
The new financial world is pouring its creative energy into this explosion of new Crypto
Tokens and exciting business models. But liquidity—that less headline-grabbing yet
fundamental element—is getting left behind. What if an individual or business’ most
significant asset is tied to a specific Crypto Token, without liquidity? They would be
in serious trouble. This issue already exists today. The largest liquidity providers in
traditional finance are global banks and other financial institutions such as Goldman
Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Deutsche Bank.
Can QUOINE achieve the same status in the Crypto economy? We believe we can.
Read on to find out how.

Currently, the liquidity landscapes for Crypto Tokens are fragmented. The top
cryptocurrency exchanges all offer different Crypto Token pairs, and no one exchange
dominates in any one Crypto Token pair. Furthermore, liquidity and the best prices for a
given pair can shift from one exchange to another. At any particular time, the best deal
to buy BTC might be in the US. Within the next hour, it might be in Asia or Europe. The
same is true for ETH and other Crypto Tokens.

[Changing of liquidity leaders by geography/currency]

In a sense, the various cryptocurrency exchanges are Liquidity Silos. They are liquid in
some pairs, but their liquidity is only accessible to clients of that exchange. And while
most of the exchanges offer liquidity in certain highly liquid currencies (USD, EUR, CNY,
JPY, etc.), there is no convenient and highly-liquid on-ramp into the Crypto world for
holders of minor currencies such as CAD, NZD, SGD, PHP, IDR, etc. Separately, each
market’s liquidity remains small, but collectively they represent a large untapped source
of liquidity that now desperately wants an on-ramp into the Crypto world.

3.1 World Book
3.1.1 Multi-Market Order Book
The LIQUID Platform’s World Book offers a multi-market order book that aggregates the

order book, allowing orders to be placed in the currency of one’s choice:

[Multi-Market Order Book]

The World Book solves two important problems that limit liquidity in the Crypto world:
Liquidity Silos and Underserved Markets.
As mentioned above, Liquidity Silos are pockets of liquidity that exist because
liquidity at one exchange in one currency pair (e.g. BTC/USD at exchange A) cannot
easily access the opposite liquidity if it exists on another exchange (e.g. BTC/EUR at
exchange B). Underserved Markets are smaller markets that, in isolation, are not yet
big enough to support their own liquid Crypto Token.
People in the countries that only have Liquidity Silos and Underserved Markets would
like to be able to trade the Crypto Token in their home currencies, but there is no
highly-liquid on-ramp into the Crypto world for them.
The Liquidity Silos and Underserved Markets problems are solved by connecting
these exchanges into a single point of liquidity, and by allowing the order book to be
priced in any of the major currencies and many minor currencies.

17

Under the hood, the World Book is a composite of two order books:
Internal Order Book: An order book that contains FX-adjusted orders for all
orders placed by users of the World Book.
External Aggregated Order Book: An order book that contains all other
orders (but FX adjusted) that exist throughout the world other than those
placed in Internal Order Book. Each order in this book is linked to an order
on the various exchanges internationally.

[Diagram of the World Book]

The LIQUID Platform’s World Book supports trading in the quote currency of one’s
choice. To understand how useful this is, it is helpful to understand that trading pairs
in the Crypto Token and FX worlds are composed of a Base Currency (what you are
buying and selling, e.g.: BTC, ETH, etc.), and a Quote Currency (the currency in which
you see the price, e.g.: USD, EUR, etc.). It is also possible to have pure Crypto Token
pairs such as ETH/BTC – which has a Base Currency of ETH, and Quote Currency of
BTC. Traders using the World Book have the option of selecting their Quote Currency
from any of the major fiat currencies, plus some Crypto Tokens.
For example, a German trader (A) wishing to sell BTC (Base Currency) can choose to
see the World Book for BTC in EUR (their Quote Currency). When they place an order in
the World Book, they see their order enter the BTC/EUR market, and the order’s price
is reflected in their orderbook in EUR. While, a Singapore trader, using the World book,
18

will see the entire order book in their own currency of choice, likely SGD. They will
see the order that was placed in BTC/EUR by the German Trader, priced in SGD – and
from the Singapore trader’s perspective, the German trader’s order will fluctuate with
changes in the EUR/SGD rates. If the order to sell BTC/EUR is matched with an order to
buy BTC/SGD, an FX conversion happens behind the scenes. Both parties receive their
execution in the respective currencies of their orders.

3.1.2 The Architecture
Underpinning LIQUID Platform’s World Book are three technologies that are already
used extensively by QUOINE on a daily basis:
1. Matching Engine (ME)
2. Cross Currency Conversion Engine (CCCE)
3. Smart Order Routing (SOR)
Matching Engine (ME):
Built from scratch by combining decades of experience in financial technology, the World
Book’s Matching Engine (ME) is capable of processing several million transactions per
second, making it one of the most advanced matching engines in the industry.
The ME has been architected to be hyper-scalable to support a very high number
of markets (Crypto Token pairs) and offers native support for a number of key order
types, around which a powerful Order Management System has been built.
All these features, coupled with “built to fail” resiliency, make the World Book’s ME
one of the best in the market.

Cross Currency Conversion Engine (CCCE)
The Cross Currency Conversion Engine allows for near-instant, automated currency
conversions: When an execution is confirmed, and the two parties don’t share the
same Quote Currency, a Quote Currency conversion is necessary. For example, if two
clients of the World Book are both trading ETH (the Base Currency), but one of them
is trading it in SGD and the other in USD, an FX conversion using USD/SGD must be
added to the transaction to complete the match. The CCCE automatically performs this
when the match is confirmed. It is also constantly adjusting, in real-time pricing, the
order book to reflect the current executable exchange rates. It should be mentioned
here that this currency conversion is not limited to fiat. For example, using ETH/BTC for
currency conversion, it becomes possible to provide a match between an order placed
in ETH/SGD, and one placed in BTC/SGD.
Furthermore, adding a fiat FX conversion allows for matches between pairs such as
ETH/EUR and BTC/SGD (see diagram below. Using the CCCE allows the World Book
and Smart Order Routing (SOR) to source liquidity from multiple places that are not
normally matched, allowing the World Book to tap into additional sources of liquidity.
An order is sent to the FX
markets to SELL SGD
and BUY EUR

Smart Order Routing (SOR):
The Smart Order Routing Technology maintains low-latency, real-time (R/T) feeds for
all major exchanges throughout the world.
When any of those order books changes, it’s reflected in LIQUID Platform’s World
Book.
When an order is placed on the World Book, and no match is available internally, the
Smart Order Routing Technology checks to see if there is a match available on another
exchange. If so, it automatically routes the order in the currency of the order on the
other exchange.

3.2 Prime Brokerage
The LIQUID Platform’s Prime Brokerage is comprised by a suite of services that
provide users with tools to reduce counterparty risk and increase ROI. Prime Brokerage
includes so-called Direct Market Access, Fiat Management, and Credit Facility as its
core offering.
Users are now able to trade directly on any global reputable exchange, without even
having an account or funds on those exchanges.
LIQUID Platform users will gain the following benefits:
1. Reduction of Counterparty Risk: Users of the LIQUID Platform will only
ever need to deal with QUOINE as their counterparty. QUOINE is regulated
in Japan by the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA), known as one of the
strictest regulators in the world. The JFSA officially licensed QUOINE as
a Digital Currency Exchange in September 2017.
2. Increase in Capital Efficiency: LIQUID Platform users will be able to deal on
other exchanges without having to move funds directly. Capital movements
will be done via QUOINE’s funding facilities, and should be instant for both
Crypto Token and fiat.
3. Netting of positions: Users of the LIQUID Platform will have the ability to
net positions taken across different trading venues. This will allow market
participants to better take advantage of inefficiencies in the sometimes
fractured crypto markets.

3.2.1 Direct Market Access
The Prime Brokerage allows its users to leverage QUOINE’s Smart Order Routing
(SOR) technology and connectivity to all reputable global exchanges, and get Direct
Market Access for the fastest and best execution from a single platform.
With our state-of-the-art trading dashboards, users of the LIQUID Platform will be able
to manage their trading books, place orders, monitor risk and keep an eye on all global
markets on major exchanges, 24/7.
Our Order Management System (OMS) and Matching Engine (ME) provide

23

unparalleled banking-level performance capable of processing millions of orders
per second. Our OMS provides a professional-grade FIX API, with both common and
advanced order types and execution algorithms.

3.2.2 Fiat Management
Fiat Management is one of the most difficult (and restricted) constraints when it comes
to providing liquidity to the market. Moving large sums of fiat is slow, expensive and
time consuming – which is one of the reasons Crypto Tokens are the future of finance.
Over the past three years, QUOINE has built an extensive network of relationships
with banks. Part of our banking strategy has been to co-locate our bank accounts with
those of other major exchanges, by creating accounts in the same bank—and in many
cases the same branch—as other exchanges.
We have also begun working with a major global bank to provide fiat transfer optimization.
This will allow us to complete immediate fiat transfers globally. This service will also
be available to third party liquidity providers using the Prime Brokerage. QUOINE is
planning to obtain a Funds Transfer Service Provider License and any other permits
or licenses when required.

Why This Innovation Matters
for Liquidity
There are many third party liquidity providers that provide
only limited liquidity. Their liquidity provision is substantially
constrained by the time and cost of moving fiat. By providing
this service as part of our Prime Brokerage, third party liquidity
providers will be incentivized to use the platform—because it will
allow them to better monetize their capital.

24

3.2.3 Crypto/Fiat Credit
The LIQUID Platform’s Prime Brokerage will extend its Crypto/Fiat Credit facility to
users to leverage their existing balances for enhanced trading opportunities. Crypto/
Fiat Credit facility allows users to borrow using either fiat or Crypto Token as collateral.
QUOINE LIQUID TOKEN (QASH) can also be used as collateral for trading. (more on our
Token in the following sections.)
QUOINE is also in the process of applying for a formal Banking License, to expand the
range of services we can offer our users. QUOINE will also obtain any other permits or
licenses when required.

3.2.4 Real Time Reporting
The Prime Brokerage users will have access to customized activity statements, to view
detailed information about their account activity including positions, cash balances,
transactions, and more. They will be able to run trade confirmation reports to view all
executions.

25

3.3 Other Services
3.3.1 System Co-Location
Our LIQUID Platform provides co-location on one of our powerful private servers
physically located near our Matching Engine and OMS system—or near liquidity
venues within our network of exchange partners.
We provide support for mainstream programming languages. Users of the LIQUID
Platform will be able to deploy their own strategies and also offer them to other
customers on the platform at a fee.

3.3.2 Automated Trading Strategies
Our LIQUID Platform provides access to third party trading strategies, and to its own
automated trading and market-making strategies. Users can select from a published
list of automated algorithmic strategies, then have their asset traded using these
strategies. Strategies will be published and will be accessible by our users. Historical
performance and other details on strategies will be available to users to aid them in the
selection process.
Initially, these strategies will be provided by QUOINE. However the platform, data, and
tools we use will be made available to thousands of data scientists throughout the
industry, allowing access to any individual or teams with the talent/skill to design and
offer their own trading strategies.
Examples of trading strategy use cases:
1. ICO/ITS token issuers can use automated market making strategies to do
market making for their tokens.
2. Talented quants and trading system developers can design their own
trading systems and then use them to trade their own assets—or share them
publicly for a share of the profits and/or a fee.
3. Crypto Token holders can select one or a basket of strategies and then
have their asset automatically traded using the automate strategies.
Automated Trading Strategies will be provided only to the extent permitted by the
applicable laws, regulations and rules.
26

3.3.3 Trading Tools
Users of the QUOINE LIQUID Platform have access to best-in-class trading tools
developed over the years for QUOINE products.
Among these tools, users have full access to a powerful trading dashboard, developed
for QUOINE products and adapted for the LIQUID Platform.
Users have access to tools to manage their trades and positions, monitor global markets
in real time, enter and manage orders, view live charts, etc.

04
QASH Token Sale

28

4.1 Token Overview
The Crypto economy has given us a whole new way to build new distributed infrastructure
through the use of Crypto Tokens. People are coming together to fund something they
truly want, something they truly believe in. And as Token Holders, they are benefiting
from the growth in its utility and value.
QUOINE, through QUOINE LIQUID TOKEN (QASH), is building a financial utility—a
platform that the entire Crypto economy will benefit from and where people can
participate in as both users and token holders.
QASH will be issued by QUOINE Pte. Ltd and may be distributed by itself and/or
designated distributors. Please note that QASH does not represent any equity in
QUOINE and does not entitle holders to any voting rights, dividends or profit-sharing
of any entities of QUOINE. QASH is a Crypto Token that can be used as the fuel that
powers all services provided by the LIQUID Platform and QUOINE’s existing platforms
(QUOINEX and QRYPTOS).
QASH has two main functions:
1. as Crypto Token users can pay for services on all of our platforms;
2. as a tradable Crypto Token on the open market.
On top of these, QASH will open up to all financial and any other industries. QUOINE
will not limit the usage of QASH nor business entities that would like to use QASH for
their business. Therefore, any companies or organizations, individuals may be able to
utilize QASH as a Crypto Token such as Bitcoin, Ethereum’s ETH and Ripple’s XRP.
As the demand for the LIQUID Platform grows, the utility of QASH will increase and will
allow QASH holders to use its value to “pay for” all services and functions QUOINE and
its partners will provide.

We envision QASH could even become the preferred
standard Token used to pay for all services provided by
the broader financial industry, as participants gradually
migrate to decentralized platforms.
29

QUOINE is already in discussion with multiple financial institutions, FinTech startups,
and partners to make QASH the preferred payment Token for upcoming and existing
financial services.

4.1.1 Token Utility
Initially, QASH value will be used for services provided by the LIQUID Platform and
QUOINE—to cover fees, as credit collateral, and to participate in trading strategies.
QASH holders can use value in return for:
Transaction Fees
LIQUID Platform
QRYPTOS
QUOINEX
Prime Brokerage
Direct Market Access
Fiat Management
Crypto / Fiat Credit
Other Services
System Co-location
Automated Trading Strategies
Trading Tools

4.1.2 Listed Tradeble Assets
QASH will be tradable on QUOINE’s trading platform—and on other exchanges. Having
QASH listed on various exchanges is another way we expect the Token utility to increase
with liquidity.

4.1.3 Exclusive Owner Benefits
Finally, as an added incentive, QASH owners will receive periodic promotions,
discounted fees, preferential access to new products/services, and opportunities to
invest in future ICO/Token Sales that QUOINE will help launch.

4.3 Token Sale Process
Each day, more and more token issuers are experiencing cyber-attacks, hacks, and
impersonators which have led to multimillion dollars’ worth of theft. This is because
current ICO platforms do not have the proper security measures in place for purchasers
to deposit and transfer their funds. Deposits are typically transferred from one ETH
address to another without proper KYC checks, often using a single publicly announced
address for purchasers to send their funds. Hackers and scammers take advantage of
this by posting fake ETH addresses on forums, and unsuspecting token purchasers
end up transferring crypto to the hackers’ addresses.
To ensure this does not happen with our Token Sale, we have placed stringent,
preventative measures to ensure a safe, secure, and compliant process for all token
participants. We will carry out our Token Sale only through our secure trading and
exchange platform, QRYPTOS.

All purchasers will need to set up an account on QRYPTOS
to transfer crypto funds securely to participate in the QASH
Token Sale.
The registration steps to setup an account on QRYPTOS
and participate in our Token Sale are explained on the
following page.

32

1. Create/Activate your QRYPTOS account.
a. From the LIQUID landing page (http://liquid.plus), click “Register Now”.
This button will take you to QUOINE’s QRYPTOS registration page (https://
accounts.qryptos.com/sign-up).
b. Screen instructions will guide you through your QRYPTOS account
registration. You will need to provide some basic information including
your name, email address, home address, and securing your login by
activating 2-Factor Authentication with the Google Authenticator app.
More detailed instructions can be found from our Help Center.
c. Upon completing the above, an email containing an account confirmation/
activation link will be sent to your email address from service@quoine.com.
Click the link to activate your account. You may now pre-fund prior to the
actual token sale.

2. Fund your QRYPTOS account and buy QASH.
a. Upon logging into QRYPTOS (2FA code required), you will be able to
fund your account with either BTC or ETH and purchase QASH. Each QASH
purchaser will be allocated a unique BTC or ETH deposit address for funding.
b. Upon funding his/her account, the Purchaser simply clicks on “Buy
QASH”, enter the amount the Purchaser wishes to purchase, and hits submit.
QRYPTOS will automatically deduct the appropriate amount of BTC or ETH
from the Purchaser’s account and add purchased QASH tokens. In the case
that the Purchaser placed BTC in his/her account, QUOINE determines an
amount of BTC deducted from the Purchaser’s account in accordance with
the amount of QASH entered by such Purchaser on the basis of market value
of ETH/BTC (determined in reasonable discretion of QUOINE) at the time of
the purchase.

33

1. Please note that any purchase order cannot be withdrawn or cancelled once it is
made.
2. Existing QUOINE users who already have a QRYPTOS account can immediately
participate in the token sale by clicking the “Purchase QASH” button in their Home
Account tab.
3. QUOINE will not provide any generic funding address through any social media,
messaging services, bulletin boards, etc.as most ICO hacks are happening this way.
4. QASH Token Sale will commence at 00:01, Singapore time (UTC + 8 hours), on 6th
November 2017 and end at 23:59, Singapore time (UTC + 8 hours), on 8th November
2017 (the Sales Period).
5. If the total amount of the purchase requests exceeds the maximum offer within the
Sales Period, QUOINE will pro-rate QASH according to the ratio of the purchaser’s
request.
6. If QUOINE cannot meet its Minimum Token Requirement of 50,000,000 QASH within
the Sales Period, QUOINE will return the deposit after subtracting handling and / or
network fees.

34

4.4 Use of Proceeds
Immediately after the Token Sale, Token ownership will be as follows (Year 1).
By Year 5, QUOINE will fully distribute the r​eserves​and only retain 20% allocated to

4.5 QASH Blockchain
QASH will initially be built on top of Ethereum’s ERC-20 Token Standard.
By Q2 2019, QUOINE will create its own blockchain (QASH BLOCKCHAIN) that will have
specific financial industry requirements already built in. Currently, none of the existing
blockchains (including Ethereum) offer sophisticated tools to build any meaningful or
scalable financial services on top of their blockchains (other than basic services such
as payments and transfers).
All QUOINE services will be migrated to the QASH BLOCKCHAIN and the existing ERC20 based QASH will also be exchanged to the newly created QASH token on the QASH
BLOCKCHAIN.
The QASH BLOCKCHAIN will support more sophisticated financial industry programming
languages (Python-like language and other commonly used languages in the financial
industry) for the design and construction of smart contracts that will allow financial
institutions and fintech startups to build decentralized financial services on top of the
QASH BLOCKCHAIN. When we launch in Q2 2019, the QASH BLOCKCHAIN will have
the following features:
1. KYC/AML
2. Node Management (Region Restrictions)
3. Financial Service Features
a) Credit / Lending Management
b) Market Data Distribution
c) Margin Management
d) Matching Engine
e) Market Making Engine
f) Issuance of new Crypto Tokens
g) Banking
h) Etc.
QUOINE is creating a financial services based blockchain that will be powered by QASH.
As more FinTech services utilize the QASH blockchain, we anticipate QASH becoming
the token of choice by a growing ecosystem of financial service providers thus causing
the utility of QASH to grow.

36

05
Who Benefits

37

5.1 Individual and Institutional Traders
Access to Great Technology
Over the years, QUOINE has built state-of-the-art, high-availability, and highperformance technology for connectivity to the majority of global Crypto exchanges.
This includes Smart Order Routing (SOR) and Order Management (OMS) technology
to manage orders for each exchange in our network, in addition to a powerful real time
market data infrastructure covering all relevant global Crypto exchanges.
Access to the World’s Liquidity
The ever-increasing number of Crypto Tokens and exchanges presents both a
significant opportunity and a challenge for investors and traders alike. Between USD
4 and 5 billion are traded daily in Crypto Token markets across dozens of exchanges,
with volatility well over 10% in the recent past. This presents a sizeable opportunity for
traders and investors.
The chart below shows the spreads across major exchanges for BTC:

38

Reduced Risk
The challenge lies in having access to all the profitable opportunities in an efficient and
secure manner, with as little risk as possible.
At the time of writing, it is quite difficult (even impossible) to fully take advantage
of these opportunities due to various factors. These range from counterparty risk
to technology limitations, financial/banking restrictions, high price volatility, capital
inefficiency, and an overall lack of clear and fair pricing.
Counterparty risk alone poses a significant challenge when it comes to centralized
unregulated exchanges. In the past year, every single one of the top five exchanges
excluding QUOINE (measured by trading volume) has been hacked and had funds
stolen, costing customers millions—and in some cases tens of millions—of USD in
losses.
Access to Professional-Grade Services
The services that the QUOINE LIQUID Platform offers are already powerful when used
on their own, but they can have a much stronger impact when coupled with our Prime
Brokerage, Fiat Management Services, and sophisticated reporting tools.
Trading at the scale our LIQUID Platform provides will no longer be the exclusive
privilege of the few.
We are launching a fully open, super-connected platform that will allow anybody,
anywhere to participate and benefit from the trading opportunities that the Crypto
economy has to offer.
This is real democratization of finance.

39

5.2 Token Issuers
Currently, there are hundreds of new Crypto Tokens being created to support various
services their issuers intend to offer, across a variety of industries.
The challenge, as discussed in previous sections, is that there is usually zero (or very
limited) liquidity due to their being new issues. This poses a problem for new Crypto
Token holders and issuers alike.

QUOINE will open its Crypto-only exchange, QRYPTOS, to
token holders and token issuers except for Crypto Tokens
that would be categorized as securities or some other
regulated financial products that QRYPTOS cannot handle
with will not be listed in QRYPTOS.

Token issuers will be able to leverage all of LIQUID Platform’s technologies and services
to create a market for their Token in QRYPTOS. Our LIQUID Platform will be capable
of fully supporting the new emerging Crypto Token economy, and help eliminate the
current liquidity challenges it is facing.
Token Issuers will be able to auto-setup an initial/secondary offering and marketmaking, or as part of a managed service. LIQUID Platform’s World Book and Market
Data Services, coupled with specialized market-making strategies, will allow marketmaking for new Crypto Tokens—and in turn, the creation of liquidity and fair pricing for
new Crypto Tokens.
Features include
• Web-based, self-service setup on QRYPTOS (www.qryptos.com)
• Use of LIQUID Platform’s high-performance Matching Engine
• Market Data Services
• Tools to do own market-making, or use LIQUID Platform’s market-making
as a service (Token Issuer will need to provide inventory)
40

5.3 Token Holders
Early participants in the Crypto world who participated in ICOs and Token sales have a
significant portion of their assets invested and tied up in various Crypto Tokens.
The LIQUID Platform’s success will benefit token holders by providing increased price
stability and less market manipulation, leading to higher valuations of their Crypto
Token assets.
The LIQUID Platform will also provide token holders with the following additional
services:
Crypto Lending
Token holders may lend their Crypto Tokens for a fee at QRYPTOS. Doing so adds
liquidity to the Token market, by providing the necessary inventory for liquidity providers
who trade on margin. This increases the overall liquidity of the specific Token.
Token Liquidation Service
When token holders have significant assets tied to a specific Crypto Token—and there
is a need to liquidate quickly—this liquidation can disrupt the token market and can
even cause token markets to crash. Holders can use third party services, but these are
expensive, non-transparent, and can lead to information leakage.
Using the LIQUID Platform, World Book and sophisticated automated order types,
holders can liquidate large positions without disrupting the market for the Crypto
Token—and without having to engage third party services.

5.4 Financial Services Innovators and Society at
Large
Cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain/distributed ledger technologies are
a key facilitator for many of the applications, products and services being introduced
as part of the irreversible wave of innovation currently taking place in the financial
services industry.
This wave of new innovations, sometimes referred to as, “the FinTech Revolution”,
promises to completely disrupt traditional financial services on all fronts. It will ultimately
41

bring better, faster, cheaper, middleman-free financial services to everyone, including
the world’s estimated more than 2.5 billion “unbanked” with no access to banks at
all. There are also countless “underbanked” individuals and businesses who can’t get
credit using traditional banking, due to lack of credit histories and other reasons.
QUOINE’s global network of exchange and banking relationships, regulatory licenses,
and compliance/security frameworks can fill the gaps for many of the existing FinTech
alternative models for intra-country and international remittances, payments and
lending.

We envision QASH to become the preferred token that can
be used in the broader financial industry to power financial
services as they migrate to decentralized platforms.

42

06
QUOINE’s Competitive
Advantage

Unlike most other Token offerings so
far, the LIQUID Platform is a real product
backed by a world class company
(QUOINE).
It has a strong management team with
hundreds of years of combined financial
technology experience, and live-scalable
products that are already used by hundreds
of thousands of active users.
43

6.1 World Class Team
We have assembled a world class team with over 250 years of combined experience
in Finance and Technology.
Our team has a proven track record in Forex IT, Forex Trading, Algos, Equity Trading
Systems, and FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities)—all combined with
expertise in Internet and mobile technology.
Most notably, we have built QUOINEX—one of the largest Cryptocurrency exchanges
in the world. It is regulated by the Japan FSA and is fully aligned with the requirements
of most regulated markets around the world.
QUOINE’s management team has worked at the following companies:
• Financial Institutions: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Barclays, UBS, ANZ, Union Bank, Rabobank, Wells
Fargo Bank, Bloomberg, Price Waterhouse Coopers, Simplex, Scotty D.
Group, Capital Markets Trading, etc.
• Internet and Technology: SoftBank Group Corp., SAMSUNG, SingTel,
BSB, Hike, Gungho Online Entertainment, Grab, Luxola, Protiviti, SAP, etc.
• Others: Mitsubishi Corporation, Anderson Consulting, AirAsia, Sephora,
etc.

6.2 Product Readiness
Our core product development is already completed. There is zero risk on core product
development.
The LIQUID Platform:
• Is connected to all the major reputable exchanges worldwide from a single
platform.
• Provides an unparalleled and powerful suite of trading services to both
individual and institutional traders.

44

Our product-market fit is unquestionable.
The Crypto economy needs liquidity and we are solving
a fundamental problem. We will continuously improve our
products using our cutting-edge technologies.

We know how to scale. We built QUOINEX to become one
of the largest exchanges in the world.

As is the case with all startups, though, 90% of companies will unfortunately fail during
product development and product-market fit stages. However QUOINE is already past
that “valley of death”.

6.3 Exchange and Banking Relationships
Over the past three years, QUOINE has built and connected with global exchanges
and banks on all major continents—which the LIQUID Platform is able to leverage.
The amount of work (resources, regulation, professional services) makes our LIQUID
Platform truly unique.
We have been able to build these relationships as we are fully compliant, regulated,
and have never experienced any significant incidents or theft on any of our existing
platforms (both QUOINEX and QRYPTOS).
Exchanges: The LIQUID Platform is connected to over 15 Cryptocurrency
exchanges around the world. We have already performed extensive due
diligence to assess counterparty risk, and have implemented a tiered
monitoring system.
Banks: The LIQUID Platform has bank accounts in Japan, US, EU, Taiwan,
Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, with more to come. The account opening
process takes anywhere from six months to two years—that is, if successful at
all (most banks still reject and have a zero-tolerance policy for Cryptocurrency
startups). Our team has succeeded where most others have failed.

6.4 Regulated in Japan
QUOINE’s parent company QUOINE Corp. operates a fully-regulated Cryptocurrency
exchange under the Japan Financial Services Agency and we were the first global
exchange to be officially licensed on September 28th 2017 (License No. 00002).
We are the first exchange in the world fully regulated at the country-level—bringing
security, reliability, compliance, and governance across our entire range of products
and services.

6.5 Compliance and Security
We are proud that QUOINE’s products are the most compliant services in the Crypto
Token space. With Ken Mazzio as our Chief Compliance Officer, a strong team of risk
officers including an independent internal auditor, a Big 4 firm as our external auditor,
compliance training for all employees, and an annual compliance plan agreed by our
Risk Management Committee and carried out by our entire senior management team,

46

we have built a culture of compliance within QUOINE.
We recognize the risks of money laundering and terrorism financing to the reputation
of the Crypto industry and society at large, and we continuously strive to enhance our
program to be the leading example of best practices in the Crypto world.
This culture is what allowed us to open banking accounts around the world, where
others could not. No other Crypto company has this much reach and depth, especially
in fiat.
QUOINE strictly complies with FATF guidelines when we operate in jurisdictions where
the Crypto industry is not yet subject to specific AML regulation. We comply with all
applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We also use
world class tools such as KYCsphere and Thompson Reuters World-Check One to
manage our AML compliance and “Know Your Customer” obligations, perform sanctions
screening (UN, OFAC, EU, etc.), and help identify Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs).
On the Security and Privacy side, we took our years of experience working with bankgrade security and combined it with the most up-to-date tools and techniques to
leapfrog traditional financial institutions.
We have achieved a new FinTech-grade security program covering all the key security
domains. These are:
1. Access Control
2. Application Development Security
3. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning
4. Cryptography
5. Information Security Governance and Risk Management
6. Legal Regulations, Investigations and Compliance
7. Operations Security
8. Physical and Environmental Security
9. Security Architecture and Design
10. Telecommunications and Network Security
In addition to our internal team, processes and tools – plus the state-of-the-art external
security tools and services we use—we engage specialized external penetration
testers and even crowd-sourced penetration testing services to stay ahead of wouldbe attackers. This protects the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our systems,
information—and ultimately our users.

At QUOINE, security is a 24/7 activity. It’s everybody’s
responsibility, managed by our Risk Management
Committee which is comprised of our senior managers
from all areas of the business, and supported by state-ofthe-art technologies and tools.

From the beginning, QUOINE believes that cryptocurrency markets will enable financial
