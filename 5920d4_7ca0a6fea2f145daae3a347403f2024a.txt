We are
Parachute.
Crypto for everyone

We’re
making
crypto fun,
easy, and
social.

With a token that fuels it all

We're pushing the next wave of
adoption by simplifying how people
send each other crypto. From using
PAR as gas for withdrawals, to using
PAR to generate a single QR code
for all of your Bitcoin, Litecoin,
Ethereum, and Doge payments, the
products we’re building allow
endless possibilities for content
creators, merchants, and individuals
alike.

We’ve launched
real-world, ass
kicking products.
We started with ParJar Telegram, the viral social
wallet that let's people instantly send crypto in
group chats for free. Our next wave of products
will include a single wallet across multiple
platforms and our very own app. We're here to
make crypto as easy as cash, whether it's
between your friends or your business.

And have the best community
in crypto
We launched by giving away 25% of all the
PAR in existence to people who got
involved. As we grow, we're giving out an
additional 28% of our total supply to
people who participate in our massive
community programs.

Send coins with a swipe in group
chats with your friends

Pick a friend.
Send a coin.
Boom.

Check balances, transfer
coins, and make deposits

We’ve started local and are building
for the future of ﬁnance.

We are Parachute.
Parachute was founded by a group of friends who wanted to change how people interact
with cryptocurrency. Today, we're inspired to build amazing tools that help people use it in
their daily lives. We believe cryptocurrency should be fun, easy, and social. Everything we
do aims to make this happen. We're a traditional startup and a WeWork Labs company.
Our mission is to bring cryptocurrency into the mainstream over the next 10 years.
