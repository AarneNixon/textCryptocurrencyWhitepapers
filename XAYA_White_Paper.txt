ABSTRACT
This paper presents a realisable and unique vision for the future of gaming built on top of
or using the XAYA (pronounced “zay-ya”) blockchain to manage increasingly complex and
appealing game worlds as well as securing and simplifying the ownership, sharing, and trade
of virtual assets.
The XAYA platform achieves this through the democratisation of game development and
deployment, allowing developers to bring their vision to life quickly with significantly reduced
costs. It will provide a wealth of tools and a state-of-the-art infrastructure for game developers to
build their own blockchain-based games. Furthermore, developers can fully leverage the XAYA
technology to issue their own game currency that can be traded for ‘CHI’ (the reserve currency
and “fuel” in the XAYA ecosystem - the X is pronounced ‘chi’ in the old greek alphabet) or other
XAYA game coins and assets.
Additionally to the benefit of gamers, developers can create fully decentralised, autonomous
games where players can expect 100% uptime and have provably fair gameplay with true
ownership of their in-game items.
Until now scaling has been a major difficulty for blockchains and particularly for massive
game worlds and their virtual asset inventories. The XAYA team has overcome this with
world leading breakthroughs in Trustless Off-chain Scaling for games (Game Channels)1
and Ephemeral Timestamps2 and will continue to invest strongly in this important and
novel field.
The assembled XAYA team is comprised of the original creators of blockchain gaming,
experienced developers, and blockchain and business experts. So whilst this is a new frontier
for cryptocurrency and gaming, the assembled team has the experience, insight, and initial
designs available to readily solve the challenges ahead. This will usher in a new era of gamechanging blockchain technology and a whole new gaming ecosystem. XAYA is developed and
maintained by Autonomous Worlds Ltd.

introduction
Our Vision
“Decentralised Realities”
Imagine countless millions of players competing and cooperating in decentralised virtual realities
that run serverless and unstoppable. In provably fair environments, they use their skill and intelligence
to harvest resources and acquire rare artefacts that hold significant real world value.
What if developers could provide autonomous, decentralised worlds, rich in tradable virtual
items for gamers? What if developers could go from concept to game release in less time and
for less money without worrying about infrastructure costs (such as servers) and recurring
costs (such as account administration)? What if we could offer true ownership, simple and safe
trading methods for gamers to convert virtual items into real world value through an entirely
flexible system? What if both gamers and developers could share in a win-win outcome with
both able to capitalise on new revenue streams and participate in thriving new economies?
What if we could realise a substantial and growing demand for a cryptocurrency, increasing its
utility and value for users?
XAYA will achieve all of this through a single, custom, blockchain-based platform that is able to
provide:
 Truly decentralised massively multiplayer Decentralised Realities (DRs)
 True and fair virtual item ownership with simple and safe trading and sharing
 Rapid and cost effective game concept to market for a wide range of new massively
multiplayer games and games in general

Just imagine, being inside a decentralised reality, unstoppable and
secure. Interacting on the blockchain itself and communicating
securely over encrypted text or voice. Imagine owning your own
virtual apartment that you can sell or trade for real world value, or
even share the keys (symbolic of encryption keys) with a friend.

A New Frontier
What is being proposed here is gaming using the blockchain to provide a secure, decentralised,
autonomous, and flexible platform upon which a variety of games can be built.
This is a new frontier in both cryptocurrency and blockchain based gaming, but it is not an
unknown frontier. In 2013, the XAYA team developed and successfully deployed the Huntercoin
experiment. This achieved a number of world firsts including, but not limited to:

 The world’s first decentralised massively multiplayer game
 The world’s first game world built entirely on the blockchain
 The world’s first human mining permissible cryptocurrency

Huntercoin was a proof of concept to develop solutions to the technical challenges and to test
the market. Huntercoin was successful and within just a few months of launch achieved over
35,000 simultaneously controlled characters3 in the game despite a low profile launch, and
despite requiring some specialist hardware (i.e. solid state drives, which were uncommon at
the time) and a reasonable level of technical know-how from the gamer. Huntercoin was largely
autonomous and required no servers or other infrastructure. It achieved a market capitalisation
of over $1 million in the first few weeks4, putting it as a top crypto currencies of the time by
market cap, and peaked to around $10 million in 20175. The Huntercoin experiment served its
purpose several years ago, and this ‘hobby project’ provided a number of world leading insights
into blockchain technology, including publication in the blockchain journal ‘Ledger’.
The XAYA platform builds upon the significant know-how developed across Namecoin and the
Huntercoin experiment and will provide a wealth of tools and infrastructure for game developers
to build their own game worlds that fit their vision and project. They can fully leverage the XAYA
technology to build decentralised games and issue their own game currency that can be traded
for ‘CHI’ or other XAYA game coins or assets.

It is important then to point out that XAYA aims to:

 Enable developers to create provably fair games in decentralised realities
 Build a blockchain-based gaming ecosystem
 Provide developers with tools for asset trading for new and existing games
 Provide a full-scale virtual asset trading platform

Experience
The assembled XAYA team is comprised of the original creators of blockchain gaming,
experienced developers, and blockchain and business experts. So whilst this is a new frontier,
the assembled team has the experience, insight, and initial designs available to readily solve
the challenges ahead and realise game-changing blockchain technology and a whole new
ecosystem.

market
Overview
XAYA addresses both the existing gaming and cryptocurrency markets and further creates an
entirely new market in the process through games created on top of the blockchain. This new
market is attributable to the creation of new virtual universes and item trading possibilities that
are substantially deeper and more flexible than other emerging and simple trading systems
using smart contracts.
XAYA targets both developers and gamers. The XAYA team aims to empower a large proportion
of new developers who find taking their game visions to market challenging because of time
and financial constraints. In this sense, XAYA aims to democratise game development.
Through the creation of a virtual item trading and sharing platform, the XAYA team aims to
allow players to generate real world value or capitalise on previous gaming achievements in new
games through the trade of virtual items from one game to the next. This is achieved through
the adoption of XAYA tools and applications by gamers and existing developers and studios.
The following sections describe the gross magnitude of the existing markets, all of which will
be addressed through XAYA.

Gaming
The video gaming market is highly lucrative and is estimated at $108.9 billion per annum6 with
a 2016-2020 forecast of 6.2% CAGR7 (Compound Annual Growth Rate) or 7.8% YoY8 in 2017.
This is in part a result of mobile gaming, which accounts for $35.3 billion with a 22% YoY
growth9, and the lowering cost of computing platforms thus increasing their accessibility to
larger human populations. Estimates of the current desktop computer gaming share vary from
$24.8 to $33.7 billion10.
The general message, however, is a consistent one, inasmuch as there are significant
opportunities and potentially billions per annum of opportunity.

THINK IT, BUILD IT, PLAY IT

Player numbers for both subscription
and freemium model games tend to be
measured in the millions for some of the
leading games. World of WarcraftTM for
example had circa 12 million subscribers in
201111.
Freemium models have emerged as a
significant means of generating revenue.
They allow players to play for free or pay in
order to improve their performance within
the game (e.g. ‘levelling up’, or acquiring
‘power ups’). The models are essentially
supported by advertising revenues and in-

Figure 1 ‘Global Games Market’

app purchases made by players. By means
of example, the Clash of ClansTM strategy game for mobile devices achieved over $45 million a
month in revenue with some estimates suggesting as high as $150 million a month12.
Arguably one of the emerging biggest growth areas within computer gaming is from the
populous Asian countries (e.g. the gaming market in Asia Pacific is growing at over $4.7 billion
per annum13). As a result, any solution proposed should consider accessing these markets
through tailoring of the solution to meet cultural and other sociological needs.
Our potential inside the gaming market initially consists of the approximately 75% of all gamers
who play on mobile and/or desktop platforms. We are not initially pursuing other non-gaming
markets that XAYA is also technologically well suited for, but this might be a long term aspiration.

Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency capitalisation is, at the time of writing of this document, circa $350 billion14 with
trades and transaction volumes accounting for billions (USD) each day. Cryptocurrencies are
becoming more accepted globally, although there are still barriers faced by their proponents.
These include regulation and usability.
The underpinning ‘blockchain’ technology behind Bitcoin and the alternatives (‘altcoins’) is
being proposed for a range of applications in banking, defence, and other sectors. Successful
cryptocurrencies bring new technologies and innovative solutions to the market, such as how
Zcash and Monero have enjoyed great popularity due to their strong privacy features. Even
Microsoft is using the Ethereum blockchain technology as part of a ‘blockchain as a service’
model.
Beyond the utility question, cryptocurrencies largely derive their value from the number of users
they have and how much they are used. That is, with many users and a high “velocity of money”,
currency values go up.
XAYA, in addition to being a cryptocurrency, is essentially a blockchain-based gaming and virtual
item trading platform. Consequently, the value of the XAYA economy will increase as more
developers and gamers adopt and use the platform. Given the time to market and cost saving
potential of XAYA, the team anticipates rapid adoption by a significant number of developers
trying to get their visions to market quickly and affordably. As pioneers in the blockchain gaming
sector, XAYA will essentially democratise gaming development.

Product
Problem Definition
There are two major aspects to the problem being solved. These are listed below:
 DEVELOPERS: Time and cost from concept to market for many new and independent
developers is often prohibitive. It is commonly known that the majority of these
developers are unable to reach the gaming market because of the aforementioned
constraints. With appropriate developer tools and using the blockchain to create
decentralised realities, with a 24/7 uptime, the costs and setup time associated with
servers or cloud based services are eliminated, as are the recurring costs, such as
user account administration. This democratisation of game development through the
blockchain will usher in a new era of game development as well as create new gaming
genres. However, there are technical challenges relating to scalability associated with
increasingly rich and complex universes within MMO games, as well as scaling challenges
associated with cryptocurrencies and asset storage ledgers. These challenges are often
underestimated, including in other emerging virtual asset storage ledgers.
 GAMERS: In general there is a growing desire for increasingly rich virtual gaming
universes in which virtual asset ownership is important for gamer status and
progression through a particular game. In addition, the time and effort expended by the
gamer could be rewarded beyond simple enjoyment alone and through the exchange of
in-game virtual items for real world value or for virtual items available in another game.
This represents a challenge on two fronts. The first challenge is that a truly scalable
and real or near real-time asset storage ledger is required for the gamer independent
of the games they play. The second challenging requirement is to create a means of
managing ownership and sharing in increasingly complex game universes, like those in
typical MMO games. Over time and given the likely high value of many virtual assets and
the gameplay itself, it will be critically important to ensure ‘provably fair’ gameplay and
‘provably fair’ item acquisition, which is not addressed in other emerging asset trading
platforms.

11

THINK IT, BUILD IT, PLAY IT

Model Characteristics
The following describes the key characteristics of the solution to the problem statement (earlier)
in terms of gamers, developers and supporters.
For gamers:
 Provably fair gameplay
 Reliability and stability (i.e. 24/7 uptime)
 Secure virtual asset ownership
 Rapid and easy trade and/or sharing of virtual assets and conversion to real world value
(e.g. play to earn or Human Mining)
 Secure social networking
 Easy to use game app launcher
 Human readable wallet accounts and “addresses”
It should be noted that in blockchain gaming, provably fair gameplay is unique to XAYA.
Other asset trading platforms require developers to pre-create or spawn all items in a closed
environment, which means that items can be printed at will. Therefore items that have been
acquired by provably fair methods will inherently have greater value.
For developers:
 Fully-, partially-, or non-decentralised game development
 Supporting scalable massively multiplayer game development
 Virtual currencies and asset creation
 Ability to build gamer loyalty
 Broad game engine compatibility (e.g. Unity, Unreal, etc.)
 Exportable game engine templates (e.g. support for Unity assets and Unreal blueprints)
 Pre-built libraries
 Accepting and managing gamer payments simply, securely, and affordably

12

THINK IT, BUILD IT, PLAY IT

For supporters:
 A cryptocurrency with high utility value (e.g. ‘CHI’ is the ‘fuel’ for games, creating
accounts, purchasing valuable in-game items, etc.)
 Access to large existing gaming markets
 Access to untapped gaming markets (e.g. virtual asset trading)
 Creation of new gaming genres (e.g. blockchain-based gaming and Human Mining)

Solution
Overview
The XAYA platform will provide a wealth of tools and infrastructure for game developers to
build their own game worlds that fit their vision and project. They can fully leverage the XAYA
technology to build decentralised games and issue their own game currency that can be traded
for CHI or other XAYA game coins/assets secured by the XAYA blockchain.

Scaling is a major difficulty for blockchains and particularly for massive game worlds. The XAYA
team has overcome this with breakthroughs in Trustless Off-chain Scaling for games (Game
Channels) and Ephemeral Timestamps and will continue to invest strongly in this important
field.

Key Technologies and Intellectual Property
The XAYA cryptocurrency will be based on a blockchain secured by proof-of-work (PoW). Player
accounts and the most important game data (e.g. ownership of valuable items) are persisted
with a decentralised name/value store built directly into the blockchain. For this, we can leverage
the experience and intellectual property that our team has gained from Namecoin (the very first
altcoin) and Huntercoin since 2013.
In addition to these proven technologies that will form the most critical fundamental layer
of XAYA, the project’s success is ensured by additional unique innovations developed by our
team:
 Atomic transactions: Pioneered in Namecoin15 16 17 by members of the XAYA team in
2013, this technique will be made easy to use in XAYA. It will allow trustless trading of
game items, game-specific currencies and whole game accounts for CHI to enable a
thriving economy on top of the XAYA platform and ensure demand for CHI.
 Game channels18: We have developed an extension of the payment channels in Bitcoin
that can be applied to game moves between multiple players off the blockchain and
thus aid in scaling XAYA to its global target size. The same concept can also be used
for “shards” of a global game world to enable limitless and near-real time gaming on the
blockchain.
 Ephemeral timestamps19: If disputes arise in a game channel (analogous to “closing”
a Bitcoin payment channel), transactions on the main blockchain need to be made in
order to resolve it. By mixing the time-stamping property of a blockchain, Merkle-ized
hash commitments, amortised mining incentives, and fraud proofs in a clever way, we’ve
been able to develop a new protocol that ensures that the occurring transaction fees can
never be a loss for any honest participant.

Technical Details
Based on the proven technology of Namecoin20, the XAYA blockchain will implement game
accounts and tradable in-game items in a way similar to Coloured Coins21. This ensures that
their ownership is securely tracked on the blockchain in a decentralised way, and it also enables
atomic (i.e. trustless) trades for CHI or between items. This works by transferring both the sold
item and the corresponding payment in CHI between the two participants of a trade in a single
(atomic) transaction. This transaction needs to be signed by both parties, so that either both
transfers happen or none. This prevents fraud where just the payment is made and the item isn’t
transferred, or vice versa. To illustrate the importance of such prevention: worldwide for every
legitimate IAP (In-App Purchase) there are 7.49 fraudulent ones22.

Figure 3 ´Atomic transaction´

Games on the XAYA platform will be based on the concept of a global ‘game state’ that was
pioneered by Huntercoin. In abstract terms, every cryptocurrency on a blockchain can be
interpreted as consensus about a global state that can be manipulated by each participant
through transactions. In Bitcoin, this state is the UTXO23 set (the shared ‘ledger’). In Ethereum,
this is the global state of all contracts. Games built on the XAYA platform can take this concept
one step further — the game state for them can be just about any global data that encodes the
whole game world in its entirety. This state is tracked by clients for specific games, so that a
XAYA client only needs to process and store states for games that it is interested in. Gamers
can update the global state through transactions made on the XAYA blockchain or through offchain game channels (see Figure 4). Time-stamping through XAYA’s blockchain ensures that all
participants in each game reach consensus on the shared game state in a decentralised and
provably fair way.
In addition to Coloured Coins described earlier, ownership of items can also be represented
directly in this game state. In this case, trading for in-game currency or other items can be done
on an internal marketplace according to rules specified by the game developer. Using pegged
sidechains or a semi-trusted escrow setup (federated sidechains)24, such in-game trading can
still be denominated in CHI.
We believe that the key to successful blockchain gaming lies in solving the scalability problem.
This is evident from the recent discussion in Bitcoin, and one of the lessons we learned from
the Huntercoin experiment (as discussed in more detail in the Game Channels paper25). We have
been able to solve the scalability problem for blockchain gaming with the invention of game
channels in 2015.
In the simplest form, game channels allow two players to perform a turn-based game in a
trustless way without recording every move persistently on the main blockchain. Instead, they
record the moves on a private “side chain”. Digital signatures and a hash-chain structure ensure
that moves cannot be forged or changed backwards in time. As long as both players agree on
the outcome of the game, the resulting prize coins (or whatever else the game is about) can
be distributed accordingly by a 2-of-2 multi-signature transaction. If the players disagree, then
the data in the sidechain allows an honest player to prove to the public that she’s in the right
according to the game rules and thus still claim her reward. See Figure 4 on the next page.

Figure 4 ´Game Channels´

Building on this simple case, one can further extend and generalise game channels to work with
multiple players and for games that are not explicitly turn-based. For more details, we refer to
section 5 and 6 in the Game Channels paper25.

17

THINK IT, BUILD IT, PLAY IT

The main issue that remains with the original game-channels design is the following: If a
dispute is raised but then resolved, the game continues as before. However, this process puts
transactions onto the main blockchain, thus removing the scalability gains and costing (both)
players transaction fees. A player whose objective is to disrupt a game built on top of XAYA
can thus repeatedly cause disputes and resolve them; this is not rational behaviour according
to game theory since it costs them unnecessary fees, but this strategy can nevertheless be
employed to irritate honest players and disturb the game platform.
The solution to this problem are ephemeral timestamps. They have the following useful two
properties:
 Nodes can send some data D to be timestamped at time T by the public P2P network
and blockchain. Due to a Merkle construction, this does not cost any blockchain space
or transaction fees per timestamp. Miners still have an economic incentive to process
these timestamps.
 Later, and only if necessary due to a dispute, such a timestamp can be used to prove to
the P2P network that another game participant could have known D at time T. This, in
turn, can be used to prove that this participant did not act in a game channel according
to the rules, and thus claim payout of the prize money. Only this act of actually using
the timestamp requires a transaction on the blockchain and transaction fees, which
are then offset by the prize money that is guaranteed to be paid out. In other words, the
cost incurred by the dispute will always be paid by the defecting player in the end via
awarding the game prize to the honest player.
With these properties, ephemeral timestamps allow us to improve game channels such that an
honest player can never lose any money due to a dispute. In the worst case, a defecting player
can just cause a minor disturbance, for which the honest player will be rewarded by winning the
game’s prize money on the spot.

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
To place the necessity of the proposed solution into perspective, a competitive analysis was
made in which XAYA is compared to the two projects that come closest in terms of what XAYA
has to offer (as currently no initiative exists that offers the same).
Enjin Coin (ENJ): provides an infrastructure for virtual asset management upon the Ethereum
platform. Enjin Coin created a new token format for virtual assets, ERC-1155, which allows
bundled transactions and items minted with ENJ. The project offers an Ethereum wallet that
natively communicates ERC-1155 assets, and is currently working to create an ecosystem of
games that utilize ENJ and a universal set of ENJ-backed items.
ENJ also offers Unity SDK to for developers to easily integrate ERC-1155s into their economy
and gameplay. It should be noted ENJ’s capacities only encapsulate items and assets. They
provide no infrastructure for blockchain-based gameplay on Ethereum. Developers looking to
create a blockchain game with ENJ assets must still utilize Solidity to program their game or
rely on an SDK by another party
Loom Network (LOOM): seeks to offer solutions to expand the capabilities and scalability of the
Ethereum network. A core product provided are Loom DappChains, a network of private side
chains, propagated by Loom, on ETH. These sidechains seek to enable “million user Dapps”.
These side chains call on Ethereum’s Tier 2 scaling solution, Plasma, to handle gameplay.
This allows for fast and free game inputs. Asset transfers still require gas fees, but at a rate
cheaper than what is typically offered by ETH. For outside clients, DappChains require a monthly
subscription to maintain access to the chain. Axie Infinity is the first Ethereum game to employ
this scaling solution, and two more in development also plan to integrate. Loom offers a Unity
SDK, so blockchain programming knowledge is not required to build a game with Loom.
A clear overview of each project’s features can be seen in Table 1 (next page).

use cases
There are multiple use cases for XAYA spanning the majority of gaming genres from simple
collectable card games to real-time strategy and virtual reality. Three concrete examples of
fully decentralised and provably fair game possibilities are described below, including some
monetisation potential for developers. Note that any game can make use of the payment
gateway or asset storage functionality in XAYA.

Collectable Card Games
As with most blockchain technology, it is possible to store assets on the blockchain. Collectable
game, sports, or other cards are simple examples of asset storage. Cards can be traded or
sold safely and securely on the XAYA blockchain using atomic transactions as pioneered by
our team over 4 years ago26. For the end user this will be a very easy to use feature using
the XAYA trading application. In addition, XAYA tools allow developers to build card games
that can be played entirely on the XAYA platform, trustless, serverless, and provably fair –
if the developer so wishes.

Real-time Strategy (RTS) / Multiplayer Online Battle Arena
(MOBA)
League of LegendsTM, DotaTM, and Heroes of StormTM, just to name a few, are part of a rapidly
growing real-time strategy genre called MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). To put the genre
in a financial context, League of LegendsTM alone took in over $1.7 billion in revenue in 201627. It
is possible to develop games of this genre entirely on the XAYA platform using game channels
and ephemeral time stamps. Developers can code the game so that matchmaking takes place
entirely on the blockchain or in a XAYA off-chain lobby, or even in a centralized fashion. The
key here is that XAYA offers a high degree of flexibility for the developer. Further advantages to
using XAYA include a true or literal 24/7 uptime, zero gaming server costs, improved scalability,
and easier monetisation by, for example, selling skins, power ups, or virtual game coins that
are used to buy these in-game items. The same is true for classic RTS games, such as Dune 2,
Command and ConquerTM, and Starcraft IITM.

21

THINK IT, BUILD IT, PLAY IT

Turn Based Games
Classic turn based games such as UFO Enemy Unknown are easily hostable on the XAYA
blockchain in a multiplayer fashion. More complex multiplayer turn based games, such as
CivilizationTM or Total WarTM, are also possible with XAYA. It is even possible without the use of
off-chain game channels and ephemeral time stamps as gamers would make all their moves in
just one transaction (tx) per turn, so this in itself reduces blockchain bloat compared to games
that require transactions more often, such as real time games. Using our unique method of
taking the game state externally as described in the technical section, a turn based game
can be playable by many tens of thousands of simultaneous players and only those who are
interested in the game need to verify that the game’s current state is correct. More specifically,
miners do not need to verify moves and actions for their validity; they only need to process
the transactions because the game state ignores invalid moves. These game genres can be
persistent worlds with, for example, procedurally generated maps (in other words, these worlds
can be infinite). Currency generated in these games can be traded for CHI and other assets,
and used to purchase in-game items or power ups. This gives these in-game currencies real
value and adds the term Human Mining to the cryptocurrency lexicon.

Other Genres and Use Cases
There are of course many other game genres and use cases, such as head-to-head games,
social VR worlds that are fully autonomous, and so on. The above are simply brief outlines with
various examples of how XAYA can power different fully decentralised and provably fair games
given its flexibility and high potential.

Monetisation
Monetisation of games with XAYA is in many ways simpler than traditional methods. The following
is by no means an exhaustive list, but covers some common cases and how monetisation can
be achieved with XAYA.
 A percentage of “banked” human mined coins go to the developer.
 A one-off fee to join or subscribe to the game, similar to how one would purchase a
boxed game.

22

THINK IT, BUILD IT, PLAY IT

 In-game stores can sell various permanent or consumable products, such as:
•

Items

•

Powerups

•

Game coins or gems

•

Unlock codes

 In-game stores can sell various permanent or consumable services, such as:
•

Healing

•

Item repair

•

Level-up training

 In-game advertising or sponsored messages
 Offer in-game services, such as an in-game trading platform
 Or any method currently available to developers
How a game is monetised is entirely up to the developer, with the added invaluable benefit of
always being able to rely on the trustless, secure backing of the XAYA blockchain with no third
parties that can potentially disrupt payments.

XAYA Growth and Revenue
GRowth
In gaming, community adoption is everything. This is why XAYA is dedicates a lot of time and
effort into building and sustaining an engaged community. By providing quality games with an
existing user base (such as Soccer Manager) we will in turn attract more developers, which will
in turn bring more players, and so on. Table 2 (next page) shows three incremental phases that
XAYA will use to that end, along with the most important aspects of each phase.
As the XAYA blockchain is open source, game developers can use it as they see fit and are not
obliged to share their revenues. This is an extra benefit for game developers, besides all benefits
that already are inherent to blockchain game development. The attractiveness of the platform
is being confirmed by the fact that developers are already stepping forward to start developing
games, and community members are active in developing apps onto XAYA.

AW will also provide services and support for developers or large game studios who would like
to build game worlds on the platform.In addition, the XAYA team is expanding it’s network in the
gaming industry daily.

Revenue
In order to maintain ongoing, long term support for XAYA, we will develop a flourishing ecosystem
with multiple revenue streams.
Through partnerships (including profit shares) and in-house game development, Autonomous
Worlds will build upon the success of past and present blockchain gaming projects. Microfees from the trading platform (Beta launch in Q1 of 2019) and commision from activities and
products in the community hub (Beta launch in Q2 of 2019) will in the long term provide an
additional and steady revenue flow.
Already there are 2 partnerships with third party game studios with agreements in place: Tricky
Fast and Soccer Manager Ltd.
The first game to be published on the XAYA blockchain will be Treat Fighter; a collectable/
strategy game developed by Tricky Fast studios. The release of the open beta will take place in

24

THINK IT, BUILD IT, PLAY IT

Figure 5 ´Revenue Model´

October 2018. The closed beta of Treat Fighter is being well responded to; the public response
to the open beta is therefore expected to be positive as well.
Soccer Manager Ltd is currently developing Soccer Manager Crypto, their latest edition to their
franchise, a soccer management game with a release targeted for December 2018. Players
will have the possibility to play-to-earn and actually own and trade their in-game assets (for
example players and entire clubs). The Soccer Manager suite of games has had over 25 million
downloads on IOS and Android and over 100,000 monthly active users on desktop versions
of the game. They have a solid and proven track record in creating successful games. The
expectations for SMC adoption are therefore positive as well.
Following the coin sale, Autonomous Worlds will continue to reach out to other studios and
potential partners to further expand into this new field which is expected to increase in market
cap exponentially in the foreseeable future.

Token Supply and Generation Event

Overview
The XAYA Token Exchange Period (TEP) will allow interested parties to exchange BTC (and
possibly other cryptocurrencies) for CHI Tokens. The TEP will be divided into two major blocks:
the public Pre-sale and the main Token Sale, each with their own hard cap. Purchased tokens
can be redeemed once the genesis block is mined.

CHI Utility
As the native currency of the XAYA ecosystem, CHI is used to fuel all transactions.
For example, it fuels:
 Account creation
 Account transactions
 Purchasing/renting game assets/accounts
 Game transactions
 CHI powered crowd sale
 Coin transactions
 And much more...
After XAYA’s main sale, CHI will be available on exchanges, starting with Liquid. A small amount
of CHI always is necessary to create accounts on the platform and to make transactions. The
in-game acquiring of assets will carry a price in CHI as well, unless of course the developer
created his or her own cryptocurrency. In that case, CHI can be traded for this coin; either in the
game itself, or via an exchange.
Whether CHI is needed to get access to a game, is entirely up to the game developer. XAYA
explicitly aims to make the platform and the games built on it accessible to as many people as
possible and to create a (near) self sustaining ecosystem. Developers and companies will be
able to decide upon prices themselves for gaming fees and in-game purchase prices. The XAYA
platform is completely open source and free to use.

26

As the XAYA economy grows, so will its utility as new and as-of-yet unimagined apps and dapps
become available to users.

Coin distribution
 Coin sale: 40.5% (max cap of 150,000,000)
 Proof-of-work coins (mineable): 40%
 Company reserved: 10% of the total supply, locked for 6 months (hard coded)
 Bounty campaign: 3.5 % of the total supply
 Advisors and additional costs: 1.5 % of the total supply
 Huntercoin snapshot: 4.5% (a snapshot was taken of Huntercoin previously29)

The proof-of-work mineable coins will be calculated based on the result of the coin sale. Coins
can be mined and distributed to miners in return for securing the network. CHI will be distributed
via PoW over many years and will follow bitcoins distribution method in which the block reward
will halve every 4 years, meaning that the PoW supply will be completely distributed in around
100 years time.

ROADmap
The XAYA roadmap is logical and straightforward. In each phase we add in tools, products, and
services for developers and gamers that expand our reach in the video game industry.
It begins with XAYA Core, the XAYA Developer Hub, and on-boarding developers. The latter being
the single most important marketing goal, as our aim is is to produce as many high-quality
games as quickly as possible in order to attract gamers to the platform.
The next phase adds in the XAYA Community Hub, additional tools and support for developers
(e.g. mobile relay service, publisher, asset trading platform), and broader outreach to the indie
game developer community. The goal here is to break ground in the mainstream and mobile
game markets with games that have broad appeal. This phase will bring a wide variety of new
games to gamers who have never experienced the freedom of the crypto-world, and expose
them to unlimited trading and sharing opportunities.
The next page shows a tentative, conservative timeline (Figure 7) with the most important marker
points for the XAYA project, starting in 2013 with the release of the world’s first blockchain
game. Depending upon the level of success of the Token Sale, elements may be accelerated
and delivered sooner.

XAYA Ecosystem
The XAYA Ecosystem is comprised of the various XAYA products and services, and is fueled
by CHI. The role of the various XAYA elements is to create an environment that fosters its own
growth, and with it the use of CHI. Attracting developers into the ecosystem results in more
games, which results in more gamers, which attract more developers, i.e. the platform creates
internal and external synergies.

XAYA Developer Hub (Alpha Release - Q4 2018)
The XAYA Developer Hub provides all the tools (SDK/API, documentation, sample code, etc.)
necessary for game developers and studios to build fully or partially decentralised games on
the XAYA platform.
For example, it will include utilities to automatically generate Unity Assets and Unreal
Blueprints based on the developer’s requirements.
In addition to tools and guides for hosting full games, it will provide tools to create and
manage both assets and game currencies for games that require only those features

Autonomous world Game Studio
The Autonomous Worlds Game Studio will develop polished tools, kits, game templates, and
prototypes to develop high-quality blockchain games. These will be used both internally, and
released externally through the XAYA Developer Hub for third party developers to use.
Through the release of in-house created games and partnerships with external game studios, the
platform will stimulate further adoption by showcasing the possibilities of blockchain gaming
and their monetisation models (as highlighted in MONETISATION).

over 25 million downloads and an eagerly awaiting audience, expectations are high for this wellestablished brand. Of particular interest to fans is the true ownership and free trading where
people can trade their soccer players and game assets for others that they prefer.

Project X - (Beta Release - Q2 2019)
Project X is a full and pure blockchain game by the AW Game Studio. It will showcase features
of the XAYA blockchain and demonstrate how blockchain games and their economies run.
Of particular interest, it will show how a provably fair, open source, Human Mining game with
scarce resources can be profitable for both game developers and players alike.

XAYA Trading Platform (Beta Release - Q1 2019)
The XAYA Trading Platform will facilitate trustless trading of CHI, XAYA-based assets, and
XAYA-based game currencies. Using technology pioneered by the XAYA team, all trades will be
atomic so that either no trade happens or both the buyer and seller get the assets they wanted.
At all times every participant will be in control of their own private keys. That is, the XAYA Trading
Platform doesn’t require possession of assets or coins to function, and all transactions are truly
person-to-person and trustless (as highlighted in TECHNICAL DETAILS), providing a fraud-proof,
seamless trade experience for XAYA users at a minimal fee.

XAYA Community Hub (Expected Alpha Release - Q2 2019)
The XAYA Community Hub is a continuously evolving community platform that will evolve and
expand as adoption increases. Gamers can launch games, socialise, get up to speed about
new releases and other platform news, and make use of the apps and services this platform
will provide.
Using the Community Hub as a PR podium, developers can publish and promote their games
and services directly to their target audiences. They can also fund new game development
through crowdsales.
Some possibilities of apps and services include:
 Game and app launcher
 News and announcements
 Secure social networking
 Blockchain game/dapp download and integration (dapp store)
 Payment gateway for blockchain games (significantly reduced costs)
 Integrated Marketplace
 Integrated Crowdfunding
 Integrated Mining
It’s important that the introduction of each element be timed properly to maximize its
effectiveness and utility within the broader XAYA ecosystem.

ecosystem synergy
Developing the XAYA ecosystem will require rotating priorities in order to achieve milestones
along the game developer, game, and gamer (user) paths. Using an agile approach to
development, priorities aim for the incremental improvement and addition of infrastructure for
developers and gamers, e.g. new tools or tutorials in the Developer Hub for developers, or new/
better Community Hub features for gamers. Some infrastructure will directly target both, e.g.
Project X will be a fun game for gamers, while it will be example code for developers.

The purpose is to synergise the effects of existing and new infrastructure at the right times in
order to amplify their roles in the ecosystem. As an example from above, the release of Project X
will follow the XAYA Trading Platform. A unique feature of Project X (compared to other games),
is that it will allow trading of all game assets through the trading platform. Here, this unique
game feature deepens the importance of the XAYA Trading Platform as both a trading tool and
a feature to enhance gameplay for gamers.
