SUN WHITEPAPER
SUN is a social experiment filled with unlimited imaginations. It is a crucial
component of the TRON DeFi. Together with the other developed decentralized
finance (DeFi) projects, it enriches the whole TRON ecosystem. It may also take part
in decentralized lending, insurance, liquidity, stable coins, etc.

SUN is completely initiated, driven and developed by the SUN community. All of
SUN’s functionalities will be implemented by open-source smart contracts, and is
wholly operated by the community. The functionalities are developed based on
community initiatives. All proposals and decision making are voted via SUN within
the community, minority obeys majority.

SUN will be deployed to the TRON Virtual Machine with smart contract, becoming a
nexus closely correlated with other existing DeFi projects.

SUN’s Spirit
Manifesting a long lasting, decentralized and a total community self-governance.

SUN’s Vision
We hope that it would be an utterly self-governed social experiment. The SUN
community would initiate more bold, radical, yet sincere and vigorous discussions, or
even put them into practice.

SUN’s Future
We are uncertain about SUN’s future, yet we believe SUN’s future is determined by
SUN’s community itself. The SUN community belongs to the SUN’s beliefs, belongs
to SUN’s miner, belongs to SUN’s HOLDER.

YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THIS!
There are no pre-mined, no reserves for the team, no venture capital (VC) or private
investments. SUN could only be mined! We inherit Bitcoin’s trait of absolute fair
distribution on SUN.

I. SUN Issuance

SUN is the digital asset, SUN in abbreviation, based on the TRC20, the technical
standard used for tokens within smart contracts on the TRON blockchain. Total token
supply is 19,900,730.

II. SUN Distribution
The distribution of the SUN is completely decentralized via mining based on the
smart contract. The only way to mine SUN is to stake TRX or TRC20 Tokens
(include Liquidity Provider LP Tokens).

1. Mining Method
Genesis Mining: Stake TRX into SUN’s smart contract. After the completion of
Genesis Mining, the smart contract will reward SUN and refund all assets back to
users’ accounts, charging no handling fees.
Regular Mining: During Regular Mining, TRX, JST, USDT, SUN, USDJ, WIN, BTT,
high-quality community projects, and liquidity mining pools will be set up. Users can
participate in mining by staking different tokens.

2. Mining Timeline
SUN Genesis Mining will formally kick off on September 2, 2020 and ends on
September 16, 2020, 2 weeks in total. Regular Mining of TRX staking mining pool will
start right after the end of Genesis Mining, 16 weeks in total.
Genesis Mining starts at 2020/9/2 21:00 SGT
Regular Mining starts at 2020/9/16 23:00 SGT
We will celebrate the official launch date of SUN, 2020/9/16 by naming that day ‘SUN
Day’.

3. Mining Reward
Genesis Mining: Every week, 930,301 SUN will be mined. A total of 1,860,602 SUN
can be mined in 2 weeks, equivalent to 9.34% of the total supply.
Regular Mining: There are TRX mining pool, TRC20 token mining pools and
liquidity provider token mining pools.

Regular Mining in TRX mining pool:
The quantity of SUN obtained by users participating in mining is determined by the
number of staked TRX and its lock-up duration. Users can participate in staking TRX,
release their staked TRX, and claim the SUN at any time.
Daily Minable SUN of TRX mining pool is as follow:

any time.

Regular Mining in Liquidity mining pool:
During Regular Mining, the quantity of SUN obtained by users participating in mining
is determined by the number of staked LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens and its lock-up
duration. Users can participate in staking LP tokens, release their staked LP tokens,
and claim the SUN at any time.

4. Mining Fairness
During the Genesis Mining period, the mining reward will be distributed fairly
according to the number of staked TRX over time. All mining rewards are calculated
based on the smart contract implementation.

Formula: Amount of genesis-mined SUN the user receives = the share of SUN the
user is entitled to * total amount of genesis-mined SUN
In which:
Total Minable SUN in Genesis Mining = 1,860,602
Total amount of genesis-mined SUN = SUN total supply * genesis-mined percentage
Share of SUN the user is entitled to = (amount of TRX the user staked * lock-up
duration) / (∑amount of TRX staked by all users * lock-up duration)

For Example: Assume there are 1860602 SUN mined during the Genesis Mining,
and there are 3 people participating: A, B & C.

A staked 10,000 TRX to the smart contract on DAY 1.
B staked 20,000 TRX to the smart contract on DAY 6.
C staked 50,000 TRX to the smart contract on DAY 9.
When the Genesis Mining ends, the mining rewards they receive are as follow:
A staked period: 14 days
B staked period: 9 days
C staked period: 6 days

Mining Contribution weighted with time = 10,000 * 14 + 20,000 * 9 + 50,000 * 6 =
620,000
A’s Mining Contribution Ratio = 10,000 * 14 / 620,000 = 22.58%
B’s Mining Contribution Ratio = 20,000 * 9 / 620,000 = 29.03%
C’s Mining Contribution Ratio = 50,000 * 6 / 620,000 = 48.39%

Finally, the amount of their SUN reward would be:
A’s mining reward: 1,860,602 * 22.58% = 420,123.93 SUN
B’s mining reward: 1,860,602 * 29.03% = 540,132.76 SUN
C’s mining reward: 1,860,602 * 48.39% = 900,345.31 SUN

5. Mining Security
The smart contract of SUN has already been audited by professional security audit
authorities. The source code of the smart contract will be publicly disclosed when the
project launches, assuring that there will be no security risk involved in staking
different assets to the smart contract.

III. Roadmap
Phase 1: Genesis Mining
Following the implementation of the smart contract, the mining reward will not be
decreased. The staked TRX cannot be unstaked until the end of the Genesis Mining
period. A one-off SUN reward will be distributed after the completion of Genesis
Mining in 24 hours.

Phase 2: Regular Mining
Following the implementation of the smart contract, the staked TRX can be unstaked
anytime, and claim the SUN reward in real time.

Phase 3: Ecosystem Docking
Docking to numerous DeFi projects within the TRON ecosystem.

Phase 4: Community Self-Governance

SUN holders are able to govern the SUN community themselves. The more SUN you
own, the greater power you have.
