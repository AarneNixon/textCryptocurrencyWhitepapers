Abstract
Since the introduction of the Bitcoin, the world of cryptocurrency has
drastically expanded. Cryptocurrency exchanges began to feel estranged
from a sudden boost in demand and have difficulties keeping up with the
sudden market growth.
As a result, many of them turned to maintaining and supporting their system
rather than development. Some even closed down the registration being
afraid to handle new users, as the number of the current ones started to
become unbearable. However, in order for the market to grow brand-new
exchange platforms should be developed.
That is why we would like to introduce you to Bitto - a reliable and easy-touse exchange platform where anyone can quickly trade, buy, and sell any
cryptocurrencies through a single convenient interface. Our goal is to help
people that believe in the power of cryptocurrency maximize their profits
on-the-go without any effort.
Here users can utilize multiple sources to get income from passive earning
to lending. Also, we have raised a team of professional traders to help users
without any trading experience by providing trading insights and give head
ups on building their own Investor Portfolio.
No matter what user role a person decides to take while interacting with
Bitto, be it a contributor, a trader, a lender, borrower, or a referrer - our
primary concern is making sure they are guaranteed to enjoy the Bitto
experience and make the most out of it (in monetary terms, of course).
This whitepaper describes the essence of the Bitto Platform, how it works,
and how it will be developed.

02

Vision
Our goal is providing users a synergetic platform for all their cryptocurrency
operations.
Our mission is to further develop the Bitto Platform following the user-centric
approach and therefore play a part in the raising the world’s awareness
about the benefits of cryptocurrency. We strive to inspire the mass adoption
of the Bitto tokens resulting in its everyday usage in society.

3

We plan to extend the reach of Bitto by using our global offices to help build
physical servers that would provide faster and smoother trading. Currently,
we are working on gathering a dedicated support team, and because we
believe in decentralized, our whole team are internationally based and
committed by a one believe that Bitto will be the next top Exchange.

03

Introduction
Exchanges are one of the first and the most popular services that have
emerged in the cryptocurrency industry and remain the largest one
regarding the number of companies and hired employees.
Exchange entities provide users with services to buy and sell their
cryptocurrencies or any other digital assets for the first currency of their
choice or other cryptocurrencies. They play an essential role in the economy
of the cryptocurrency as an available marketplace for trading, liquidity, and
price monitoring.
While the potential of the cryptocurrency market has been long ago
recognized, only in 2017, it has finally made a hit. However, even with the huge
capitalization and increased interest in this sector, the number of market
players remains low, forming an opening for new all-encompassing and
innovative solutions.
Now the world has only 51 cryptocurrency exchange platforms in 27 countries.
According to the Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study by Cambridge
Center for Alternative Finance, 52% of small exchanges have a license issued
by the government, while this percentage is only 35% among the large ones.
85% of exchanges in Asia-Pacific have no license whatsoever when the North
American exchanges are licensed.
Exchanges fall into three categories according to offered services:
• Order-book exchanges
• Brokerage services
• Trading platforms
72% of small exchanges specialize in one type of exchange activity (where
brokerage services lead), while the same percentage of large exchanges
provide multiple exchange activities like an order-book exchange, trading,
and brokerage. However, there is a shortage of platforms that cover all of the
services at the same time.

4

Most of the exchanges follow a traditional architecture, carrying out a
centralized approach to handling user’s funds. Meaning that users have to
trust their money to the third parties, which can be very dangerous and
lead to the risk of possible security breaches and loss of hundreds if not
thousands of millions of dollars.
Peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction system helps mitigate the risks. However,
platforms that utilize such services usually deal only with trading. As even if
P2P does bring users together, it cannot solve other fundamental security
issues. Therefore, the best way to avoid the risks is by putting up high
commissions and increase currency rates. And that is where we follow a
stringent guideline of working with BitGO to hand.
We offer users to try the Bitto Platform that utilizes smart contracts that help
both parties of any transaction securely pass their cryptocurrency assets.
We will also be implementing.
• Websocket API and high frequency trading support
• OAuth - KYC - 2FA
• Cloudflare to prevent DDOS attacks
• Multiple Offline and online Backup to files to prevent hacking
• Cloud servers and multi tier security implementation
• Cold Wallet integration with multi-signature protocol

Why Choose BITTO
Our team ensures that trades seamless and secure. Users will have access to six
core service models:
• P
 eer-to-peer lending and
borrowing
• I ncreasing liquidity and
encouraged financial progress

• Referral program
• Signals from professional traders
• Multiple sources of revenue

Therefore, the amount of potential profits for users of Bitto is infinite. Even having
close to zero experience in trades doesn’t affect their trading opportunities. They can
be sure to have successful trades with Bitto’s team of professional trading experts.
Users can watch their trades and copy their success.
Moreover, the income from referral commissions is also a significant financial benefit.
Users may gain up to 35% in commissions depending on whether the user is
a contributor or a non-contributor.
We also offer support for local businesses through the peer-to-peer lending service.
It helps users provide financial support for one another without jeopardizing the
growth of their cryptocurrencies.
We understand the volatility of local currencies, so we do not encourage to keep
money in the fiat currency for too long. Instead, we invite them to contribute to the
Bitto growth by acquiring Proof-of-Stake (POS) based Bitto tokens.
In a case our users are concerned about the rising challenges of energy and the
blockchain, the Bitto team has also thought about that. Instead of the proof of work
mechanism that consumes lots of energy resources and, therefore, raises the cost of
running blockchain transactions, Bitto token utilizes the POS to stabilize their income
with passive Bitto earning in an environmentally-friendly way.

06

What is BITTO
Bitto token is the official digital asset of Bitto. The Bitto token will serve as the primary
value transfer medium for users in the Bitto community.
Bitto is a Proof of Stake token based on the Ethereum token ERC20. It is backed by
the Ethereum blockchain to provide for lower transaction costs and benefits from
the rise in prices on both ETH and BTC. Contributors can purchase Bitto tokens at the
time of TGE, мand later enjoy special privileges at the launch of the Bitto exchange.
Bitto plans to distribute a total of 12 million Bitto tokens (depending on the number of
tokens sold, it may be less). Afterward, no more Bitto tokens will be produced beyond
the total supply of 23 million Bitto to protect the value of the token.

7

The price for Bitto token is $1 with further incentives and tier benefits.

07

What is Proof
of Stake?
Proof of Stake (PoS) is a category of consensus algorithms for public
blockchains that depends on a validator’s economic stake in the network.
The Proof-of-Work-based public blockchains have the algorithm rewards
participants who solve cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and
create new blocks (i.e., mining). On the contrary, the PoS-based public
blockchains allow a set of validators to take turns proposing and voting on
the next block, and the weight of each validator’s vote depends on the size of
their deposit (i.e., stake).
Significant advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization,
and energy efficiency. In general, proof of stake algorithm looks as follows.
The blockchain keeps track of a set of validators. Therefore, anyone, who
holds the blockchain’s base cryptocurrency can become a validator by
sending a special type of transaction that locks up their currency into a
deposit. The process of creating and agreeing to new blocks is then done
through a consensus algorithm that all current validators can participate in.
As a result, PoS currencies can be several thousand times more effective than
Proof of Work in costs, which relies on energy usage. It also ensures that the
holders of Bitto tokens will support the value of Bitto by reducing the tokens
circulating in market supply.

Benefits of BITTO
a. User-centric Exchange
Seamless exchange based on an environmentally-friendly proof of stake,
containing a lending platform, a dedicated support team, and a progressive
organization in one platform.
To appreciate the help of our investors, the Bitto team gives back up to
3 million Bitto tokens to our future platform users and our contributors.

b. Global Services
We are an exchange agency that wants to shape the landscape of the
current crypto-exchanges to provide dedicated servers around the globe
and ensure precision timing of trades.
We aim to deliver the impeccable customer support and security against
the DDOS attacks to all our users.
Realistic rewards and profits for our platform users and contributors offer
them a one-stop solution for all their needs.
We aim to integrate live usages of Bitto tokens by proactively partnering
with local merchants, and raising the value of Bitto tokens.

c. Bitto Buyback
A certain percentage of profits will be allocated for Buybacks and Burn
programs. It will be verified and audited using Blockchain as a form of an
accounting system. All the transactions committed for buybacks will be
published to ensure public’s confidence in Bitto Prices.
These buybacks and burns will slowly reduce market supply, increasing
staking and the value of contributors’ Bitto tokens over time.

d. Bitto Estimate
Value In a year we expect the growth of user base up to 1 mission. It is
considered a very conservative amount as it is less than 0.02% of the current
top exchanges. We believe that by integrating an all-in-one platform, our
growth rate is going to exceed our expectations to ensure rapid growth and
competitive edge for the next few years.

What Does BITTO
Offer

11

Bitto is a convenient user-centric platform for comfortable and secure
cryptocurrency exchange and trading. We offer our users a set of features
developed to make the most out of each crypto-experience:
• Staking

• Referral Program

• Lending and Borrowing

• Smart Trading

• Signal Trading

Staking
John Smith
Bitto team invites users to stake their coins
into Bitto Exchange Platform and begin
passively earning Bitto Tokens 15 days
after the contribution has been made. This
makes Bitto Exchange the first exchange
to implement an ERC20 Proof of Stake
token that can be implemented and
rewarded even on private wallets such as
Myetherwallet.
It is an environmentally friendly option
that allows the members to earn
while saving energy resources. It only
requires them to have a computer and
a wallet in a staking mode instead of
computationally intense hashing that
consumes enormous power capacities.

Lending and Borrowing
a. For Lenders

b. For Borrowers

Every user has an opportunity
to make additional income
by temporarily lending their
cryptocurrency assets to other
members of the platform. To become
a Lender, the user has to fill in a form
with an appropriate set of terms
under which they are willing to lend
out and then wait for a member to
select their offer.

Users that want to take part in trades
without selling their cryptocurrencies
have an opportunity to borrow using
cryptocurrency assets as collateral
to receive loans. They can browse
among the offers placed by potential
Lenders to choose the one with the
most suitable terms and interest
rates.

Cryptocurrency assets of each
member are protected by a smart
contract that confirms the terms
of the loan, foresees for the timely
monthly repayments and guarantees
the Lender a return on their
investment.

As the Borrower makes each payment
on time, the Bitto team tracks
their credit behavior and awards
points that can be used for credit
advantages in the future.

Once they have selected and agreed
to the Lender’s terms, they sign a
smart contract that is going to put
the Borrower’s cryptocurrency assets
as collateral. In return, the Borrower
receives a loan in their local fiat
currency directly into their bank
account.



Signal Trading
Bitto Exchange Platform offers new
members with no experience in
trading to rely on the signals of the
carefully selected and approved
professional trade managers. Their
trades, analytic skills, and trade
predictions are going to help users

performing consistently, and alert
and provide their followers with

this information. We understand
followers may not be actively
tracking their Signal’s Performance
all the time, and there is always a
chance for ups and downs. That is
why our Bitto monitoring system
looks out and protects user's
investments.

Copy Trades Easily
Signals are auto-traded, user's input
would be the amount one would
like to invest, and the amount of
commission they are willing to share.
The default percentage is 18%.

Limited Amount
Of Followers
Each Signal is given an X number of
followers to avoid a massive spike
in price and a massive dump on the
exchange.

Future
Development
of BITTO
We are focused on providing services
online and offline as well. While the
current trend today is to bring all
services and support online, we believe
in having a traditional approach to
customer interaction. By bringing a
Brick & Mortar solution service to our
clients, we believe we can raise the
interest in the cryptocurrency market.

a. Global Offices
Local support teams shall help users
and minimize backlogs of any issues
users might face on the platform.
We are going to hire Global Business
Development Managers to promote
and increase acceptance and usage
of Bitto as a cashless currency among
local merchants where it is legally
permitted.
We know that the acceptance of
the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in
real-world is already happening.
So Bitto aims to be at the forefront,
contributing to a rapid and positive
growth of the way crypto will be
viewed and accepted in the future.

17

We plan to launch of Bitto, ETH
And BTC blockchain physical ATMs
in countries where it is legally
acceptable, increasing further
awareness of the exchange and the
Bitto Cryptocurrency.
it is also going to increase merchant’s
acceptance of using Bitto, with
low transaction fees as its major
attractions.

c. Launch secured Bitto
Wallet Application
We plan to launch the First ever
Token exchange App where users can
trade Major Cryptocurrencies on our
Exchange and keep it safe and secure
in their Bitto Cold Wallet.
Using the 2-step verification services
that implement the Time-based
One-time Password Algorithm
by Google is another way we are
improving our security measures.

b. ATMs

d. Blockchain
technology that has
the benefit of both
ETH & BTC

Physical offices with Bitto ATMs
nearby will provide borrowers with fiat
currency, and also give an opportunity
to keep their tokens in the form of a
loan at the same time.

Using the ERC20 Ethereum network as
our backbone, we hope to ensure low
and quick fee transactions. (Approx.
$0.30 compared to Bitcoin $10
at peak levels).

15

Future
Implementation
There are several initiatives we plan to implement in the future:
• Voting for Signal Providers to show appreciation and raise their rate.
• B
 itto tokens will be used as an intermediary currency to buy and sell
Merchant products on Bitto Exchange.
• T
 here will be a mobile wallet Bitto exchange app with online and offline
access. (Currently, we are still testing a backup wallet in case if user's
mobile phone goes missing, so their tokens are safe.)
• A
 TMs and local offices are going to be established to provide further
exposure and ease of accessibility to users and Merchants.

16

F.A.Q.
1.0 How are lenders given priority queue?
The precedence is given to the Premium Lenders on a ‘first come; first serve’
basis via system arrangement. The system queues premium Lenders through
FIFO.

2.0 Will there be a limit to the number of Stakers?
The main factor in deciding a limited amount of stakers is going to be the
profitability ratio.

3.0 When will there be ATMs?
ATMs will only be made available in countries that accept cryptocurrency
due to regulations, thus prioritizing our offices in countries that recognize
cryptocurrency.

18

4.0 A
 re you sure the price of Bitto tokens
is going to increase?
With our low circulating supply, staking and a fruitful one-stop platform
exchange, we are confident that the price of Bitto tokens is going to increase.
We are also going to provide the users of Bitto exchange with a benefit
of a lower trading fee by paying in Bitto tokens. Buyback Funds are also
arranged to buy and burn Bitto tokens, so reducing the circulation amount
in the market gradually. We are also confident that our exchange platform
supported by our referral system and the community will attract enough
users to appreciate the value.

5.0 When will Bitto exchange be implemented?
While we understand that many of our investors are eager to see the launch
of our exchange, we want to reassure you that we are already in the midst of
setting up servers, platform, and implementation of what we promised. The
platform is being upgraded and tested to ensure that when we go LIVE in the
third quarter of 2018, we will be the best option to go to for a safe, secure, fast
and rewarding experience. Your patience will be rewarded with a highly valued
Bitto token when we finish the proper groundwork and launch our exchange
platform. Thank you for seeing this through with us.

6.0 Who are the developers of Bitto?
We are a team of young and experienced entrepreneurs and developers that
have come together to create an exchange platform that is done for the
community and by the community.
