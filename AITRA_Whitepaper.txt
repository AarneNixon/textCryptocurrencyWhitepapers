developed for automated and accurate
trading signals for the top and trending
cryptocurrencies. Aitra’s machine learning
algorithms are developed and trained
to provide you the best buy and sell
signals for maximum short and long term
profits.

All data points or technical analysis that
are popular to determine the future of a
coin like the EMA, SMA, Price Resistence
and Supports and many more are used
collectively with inputs from the top
exchanges like Binance, Huobi, Bitmex,
Coinbase Pro, Kraken, Bitfinex, etc. to
determine the best possible uptrend or
downtrend for a crypto asset.

Trained and equipped with state-of-theart algorithms and machine learning
capabilities, Aitra tools helps you view past

AITRA ANALYST TOOLS
SMA - A simple moving average (SMA) is
calculated on the average of a selected
day range of prices, usually closing prices
for the day divided by the number of days
in that range. SMA is a technical indication
to derive if a coin price will continue or
reverse or whether the coin is headed
towards a bull/bear market. SMA is
customizable by trader as it can be
calculated for various time periods and
helps in deriving the average price of the
coin over the time period specified. An uptrend in SMA indicates the coin’s price is
on the rise and a down-trend means that
price of the asset is decreasing. The longer
the time period selected for SMA the less
volatility is revealed and vice versa.

Aitra data points are derived from the top
most algorithms, tools and technique
used in Crypto trading and each result is
analysed and updated based on the
trends in the top most crypto exchanges
of the world.
Here are a few most popular tools and
instruments used in Aitra technical
analysis for trading,
EMA – The exponential moving average
(EMA) is a moving average (MA) which is
calculated based on recent data. The
exponentially weighted moving average
(EMA) algorithm is trained to react to
recent price changes than the simple
moving average (SMA) which calculates
based on an average over a long period. A
15 and 30 day exponential moving
averages (EMAs) can be used and
analyzed for short-term trading whereas
60, 90 or 150 day EMAs are used to
indicate a long-term trend for the trading
coin.

RSI – The RSI (relative strength index) is a
movement indicator used for analysis
calculating the magnitude of recent price
changes to determine overbought or
oversold conditions in the price of a coin.
It is represented as an oscillating line and
show the range between 0 to 100. This
indicator was developed by J. Welles
Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal
1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical
Trading Systems." If the RSI indicates a
value of 70 and above it means that the
coin is becoming overbought or
overvalued and may have a reversal
or slump in price. Similarly, RSI reading of
30 or below indicates a coin may be
oversold or undervalued in the current
market.

BB - Bollinger Bands are a technical
analysis tool developed by and registered
to John Bollinger for generating oversold
or overbought price signals. There are
three lines that compose Bollinger Bands:
A simple moving average (middle band)
and an upper and lower band. The upper
and lower bands are typically 2 standard
deviations +/- from a 20-day simple
moving average, but can be modified.
Bollinger Bands® are a highly
popular technique used by traders
worldwide. If the middle band is closer to
the prices of the upper band, it indicates
that the coin is getting overbought
the market, and the closer the prices
move to the lower band, the more
oversold and undervalued in the market.
John Bollinger set 22 rules to adhere to
when using the bands as a trading system.

Volume Profile - Traditional volume of
trade is represented by the X-axis whereas
Volume profile is shown on the Y-axis.
Traditionally the regular volume of trade is
the volume by time, i.e. regular volume
(on the X-axis) shows how many
transactions happened in that period.
Volume profile on the other hand is based
on price point and tells you how many
transactions happened at each price
point. The longer the bar is, the more
transactions happened at that price.
Hence regular volume is trading volume
by time but volume profile is trading
volume by price.

VPVR – Volume Profile Visible Range
(VPVR) is a basic volume profile tool that
traders use and it is represented as a
histogram. VPVR shows the volume traded
in a particular price level from the candles
shown on the screen.
VPFR - Volume Profile Fixed Ranged
(VPFR) is same as VPVR and the only
difference is that you can define the start
and end time range and see the volume
profile only for that period.
VPSV - Volume Profile Session Volume
(VPSV) is the representation of the volume
profile for all the sessions shown on a
trading chart. Each session is usually
represented by a day and it remains the
same (1 day trend) with the change of
time period of the trading chart.

Price Resistance and Supports –
Financial trading analysts use price
support and resistance levels to identify
the price points on a chart where the
probabilities favor a pause or reversal of a
trend. The support is applicable where a
downtrend is expected to stop due to a
concentration of demand and resistance
applies where an uptrend is expected to
stop due to a concentration of supply.
The market psychology plays a major role
as traders and investors remember the
past and react to changing conditions to
anticipate future market movement.
Support and resistance areas are
represented in the trading charts using
trend-lines and moving averages (MA).

FIB – The Fibonacci ratios are a popular
tool in the stock market and crypto
trading is not different. The technical
traders use them to determine critical
price points where a coin’s current price
trend is likely to reverse. The Fibonacci
retracements are the most commonly
used formula from all Fibonacci tools
because it is relatively simple, and can be
applied over any trading instrument. They
are used to draw support lines, identify
resistance levels, place stop-loss
orders, and set target prices for buy/sell.
Fibonacci retracement levels are
represented by horizontal lines that
indicate the possible locations of support
and resistance levels and it can indicate
how much of a prior move the coin price
has retraced.

(PoW) based cryptocurrencies where
rewards are given to participants who
solve complicated cryptographical puzzles
in order to validate transactions and
create new blocks (i.e. mining).
