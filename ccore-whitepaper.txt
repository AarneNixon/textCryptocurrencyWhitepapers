Introduction
A lot of time has passed, since creation
of the first Bitcoin cryptocurrency.
Cryptofinancial enthusiasts have done a
great job, created many important
projects, which led to growth of
crypto-currencies popularity around the
world.

Number of interested people sharply
increased, which was proved by growing
plurality of online wallets by several million
only in 2016. The equivalent value of many
cryptocurrencies, the total capitalization of
all electronic cash exceeded the record of
100 billion US dollars.

But with all these positive dynamics there
are a several unsolved problems. The main
problem is: business does not perceive the
crypto currency as type of payment for
goods and services due to high exchange
volatility of prices for it.

Our team develop a platform, where high
volatility of prices for cryptocurrencies will
not be a problem.
For this purpose, we created a smart contract
based on Ethereum platform and
produced 10 million Ccoin tokens. Ccoin
tokens is a digital currency which you will be
able to pay for goods or services in online
stores.

Concept and peculiarities 03
of Ccore
- what is Ccore?

- Ccore is a Crypto
Payment Platform.

It allows people who have cryptocoins/altcoins to spend them on
various fiat based online services and stores without losing value on the
exchange.
The owners of online-stores will be able to accept cryptocurrency for
payment, without losing part of their profit due to variation of crypto
rate.
Until now, most crypto currency holders perceive it as an instrument of
speculative actions on exchanges.
Large players with large assets can create profitable situations for
themselves on the market to make profit at the expense of small market
players.
In these conditions, the decentralized currency loses its economic
meaning.
The Ccore platform takes advantage of the decentralized currency,
offering advantages of working conditions to both merchants and
consumers, thereby increasing cryptocurrency circulation in business.
We can change the perception of the very essence of the
cryptocurrency from the instrument of speculation to a full-grade
currency, which can be paid both for buying the cell phone in the
online store and a cup of coffee at the restaurant.

Structure of Ccore
Ccore includes three modules:

Ccore Exchange
is a cryptocurrency
exchange where you can
change cryptocurrencies
between themselves and fiat
money.

Ccore Wallet

is a multicurrency wallet,
where users of Ccore keep
personal money.

Ccore Pay
is a complete payment system that
allows corporate clients to sell
goods and services for
cryptocurrencies by integrating
Ccore Pay into the online store
website.

How does Ccore works? 05
Ccore and market participants’ relations:

When consumer makes a cryptopayment, Ccore Pay sends it to
Ccore Exchange for automatic exchange of cryptocurrency on fiat
money.
Then received fiat money come up to the merchant’s Ccore Wallet
account.
The merchant receives a profit that does not depend on the
volatility of the cryptocurrency rate.

Ccore offers profitable working conditions to both merchants and
buyers.

When you pay for goods or services with a cryptocurrency, the
consumer does not pay any commission for transactions if he has
Ccore Wallet account.
Also, you do not have to wait for the transaction confirmation,
because the transfer occurs between the Ccore Wallet accounts.

The merchant integrates the Ccore Pay system into his online store.
Ccore Pay calculates the value of the goods for the seller's chosen
crypto currency (Ccoin tokens, BTC, ETH, etc.) at the current
exchange rate on Ccore Exchange.

What problem does
Ccore solve?

06

What are the problems?
The main problem is that the crypto-currencies can not be
equated to fiat money. In
order to clarify this problem, let us consider the main
functions of money:
• Circulation
• Accumulation
• Measure of value
Unfortunately, crypto-currencies do not have all of the
above functions. High volatility in the price of crypto
currency does not allow to ensure their stable value.
This is the main reason for the refusal of entrepreneurs
to accept crypto-currencies to pay for goods and
services.

How can we solve these problems?
Our goal is creating comfortable working conditions with cryptocurrency for all market
participants, where high volatility of the price of crypto currency is no longer a
problem.
Our team develops the Ccore platform to solve existing problems.
Point 1.3 detaily describes the relationship between Ccore and the corporate client,
where with the help of the Ccore Pay extension, working with crypto-currencies can
be perceived in business as a source of additional income.
This will lead to cryptocurrency popularity increase in the business environment. As a
result, the cryptomoney will acquire the "measure of value" function and become
fullgrade competitors for fiat money
