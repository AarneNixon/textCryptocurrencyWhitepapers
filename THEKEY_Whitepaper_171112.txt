EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

As more and more services and socializing shift from the real world to the online world,
identifying each other digitally has become a prominent theme. Development of Identity
Verification (“IDV”) Technology is one of the most significant trends, which will have a
critical impact on the digital economy. However, none of the existing online IDV
technologies addresses two fundamental requirements: results generated from online
IDV should be undeniable and unalterable.

THEKEY Project is now developing a second-generation IDV solution for the internet via
BDMI technology. BDMI stands for “Blockchain based Dynamic Multi-Dimension
Identification” technology. Such a solution perfectly echoes the main requirements for
identifying each other in the digital world, which is ‘The Key’ for migrating people
from the real world to the online world.

BDMI, as the name of it, synergistically

combines Dynamic Multi-Dimension Identification (“DMI”) technology and blockchain
technology. DMI has already passed its development stage and is currently applied to
THEKEY’s existing first-generation IDV solutions, which has built a very solid ground
work to guarantee the successful development of BDMI,

• 23 copyrights have been obtained, 15 patents have been accepted by SIPO (State
Intellectual Property office of the P.R.C) and start attestation process.
• THEKEY’s first-generation IDV solution is currently in use for mobile social insurance
pay in two pilot cities, which people can receive their payment for their pension, or
healthcare insurance reimbursement. The IDV solution is currently being deployed in
another 41 cities, covering more than 130 million people.

• Personal identity data of 210 million people in 66 cities, authenticated by the relevant
government authorities, are connected on a real-time basis. This constitutes a solid
foundation of IDV.
• Commercial contracts signed with world-leading firms and the business model of our
IDV products in this White Paper have already been partly proven.
• Six relevant national laboratories have been set up together with government agencies,
banks, insurance companies and one university.

Along with the development of a second-generation IDV solution, facilitated by token
sales, THEKEY Project team will also develop THEKEY Ecosystem for providing IDV
services (the "Ecosystem"). THEKEY Ecosystem will consist of three components of
participants (Validator, Service Provider and Individual User), Smart Contracts and TKY
Tokens (THEKEY Token). The objectives of setting up THEKEY Ecosystem are, 1) to
develop a healthy environment where Personal Identity Information (“PII”) can be
properly used and protected, and 2) to provide a financial incentive to the participants

in the Ecosystem.

THEKEY generates IDV results by crosschecking multi-dimensionally with the latest PII,
behavior data and scene data. Consider an example case for IDV process in THEKEY
Ecosystem. In THEKEY Ecosystem, when an individual user living in Beijing needs to be
identified, such as for the purchase of medical insurance in Singapore, the insurance
company will trigger a request for IDV service and start a 8-step-journey as follows:

1

The insurance company, as the service provider, triggers an IDV request including

certain medical histories of the given individual user.
2

The user accepts the IDV request by using his or her fingerprint through THEKEY

APP or the equipment of the insurance company, and also signs off the relevant Smart
Contract between the insurance company, THEKEY and the user.
3

THEKEY will review the IDV data request sent by the service provider against the

KYC (Know Your Customer) policy of the relevant industry to justify if the data request is
reasonable.

4

THEKEY will make comparisons between fingerprint data sent and the relevant

data validated by the government, and then cross check the latest PII data, behavior
data as well as scene data of the given user. These are all automatically settled through
encrypted interfaces.
5

Once THEKEY is satisfied with the validity of user’s ID, IDV will continue. Relevant

PII like medical history data will be collected as defined by the Smart Contract. THEKEY
will stamp its approval on Blockchain as verification of the result so that the medical

insurance company can use it.
6

The Smart Contract will be settled by TKY Tokens.

7

At the same time, all previous calculations will be documented for future data

audit.
8

The credit of the user and the medical insurance company will be regularly

evaluated and calculated through the above-mentioned data audit.

COPYRIGHT © 2017 THEKEY BDMI INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

The IDV result generated from the above is efficient, accurate and reliable. It could also
be tailor-made for any specific ID requirement from the Service Provider subject to
relevant applicable KYC laws and regulations. This process will significantly reduce the

cost of the insurance company and therefore further reduce the premium to be paid by
the user.

BACKGROUND

Identity Verification (“IDV”) is a day-to-day demand for a growing number of
institutions and individuals. Just think about when you open a bank account, take flights
and go abroad, go to hospital and claim social medical insurance, do shopping by using
credit cards, even open the door of your own home with a key, the request for proving
that you are ‘you’ is raised everywhere and every moment in the real world.

With services and socializing shifted from the real world to the online world, IDV is
becoming increasingly prominent. As the internet is a more anonymous space, people are
able to hide their real identities on specific websites. One specialty for IDV on the internet
is that there is no stable connection between the individual end user and the identity data
stored or uploaded on the internet for verification. A good example is credit card fraud.
The credit card user is not necessary the credit card holder himself or herself, simply
inputting the required information on the credit card would enable the payment to
proceed online. Although nowadays, banks may provide a double confirmation
mechanism such as sending a random code to a registered mobile phone. However, what
if the mobile phone has been stolen at the same time? More importantly, just like IDV in
the real world, IDV on digital world is not only a matter of digital security for privacy
protection, but also heavily involved in the discussions around financial, political, moral,
legal responsibility, and sometimes, even social stability and national security. The result of
IDV service, therefore, must be undeniable and unalterable in many cases.

The abovementioned example illustrates the features for solid IDV solution on internet
should include that ,
• The supporting data should be accurate and reliable. The identification data used for IDV
service should be the data authenticated by the relevant government authorities, not the
data uploaded by a user himself or herself. To use data uploaded by users will give room
for fraud and deceit.
• The data needs to be crosschecked with other data of the same user, but from different
sources to ensure solidity of IDV on the internet.
• The data acquired is comprehensive, and serve various IDV purposes.
• The data is updated in real time to capture any changes.
• The data is standardized and easy for digital processing;
• The data is well protected, with its safety guaranteed. This is not only for privacy
protection but also for social stability. In some cases, it needs to address national security
issues as the regulator expects.

Failure to meet these requirements might cause substantial loss, especially in the areas
indicated below:
• Asset loss in peer-to-peer value transaction, like credit card fraud.
• Legal and reputational implication, such as inappropriate statement published online by
an impostor who dishonestly uses someone else’s name.
• Disclosure or theft of personal data.

COPYRIGHT © 2017 THEKEY BDMI INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

• Disclosure of national confidential information. The data’s safety is not only related to
privacy protection, but also about national security.

Some statics based on sensitive

individual data, such as the data carrying medical and health information, are classified as
national confidential information. To avoid any misuse or causing social instability, access
to such information requires government authority approval in advance in many countries.

The existing IDV technologies, which have been developed and applied on the internet,
can meet parts of the requirements. However, none can address all the issues listed above
and the current IDV result could be denied and altered.

WHAT is THEKEY Project
THEKEY Project, a world-leading solution provider in
IDV industry, is here to leverage innovations in
Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies to develop
its second-generation IDV solution to address all the
above-mentioned issues in the internet world.

THEKEY smart contract system will use NEO smart
contract, and develop under DNA framework. THEKEY
will co-establish a smart economy which consists of
digital asset,

digital

identity

and smart

contract

together with NEO. Focusing on identity verification,
THEKEY will be the fundamental element of the whole
system. The compatibility of NEO towards multiprogramming language and the lightweight, high
concurrency and expansibility of NEOVM will facilitate
THEKEY

smart

contract

development

and

popularization in various industries.

The second-generation IDV solution will be realized by
BDMI technology. BDMI stands for “Blockchain based
Dynamic Multi-Dimension Identification” technology,
which aims to set up a powerful and cost-efficient
identity verification tool for the internet. The ultimate
objective of BDMI is to generate undeniable and
unalterable IDV results.

COPYRIGHT © 2017 THEKEY BDMI INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

11

BDMI embraces the six elements below simultaneously to deliver the perfect solution for
IDV:

1

Unique biometric data serves as the base of BDMI.

2

The key data of BDMI used for IDV, including biometric data,
are all validated in advance by the relevant government
authorities.

3

The data of BDMI used for IDV are comprehensive enough so
that it can meet the different requirements of various clients.

4

To ensure the reliability of BDMI, cross-checking is always
carried out during IDV, between the government validated ID
data and behavior data and scene data of the same user.

5

To ensure solidity of BDMI, BDMI always uses updated data
when an IDV is executed, to capture the latest changes, if any.

6

Once an IDV is completed, the result will be properly
documented for audit so that personal credit of the user can
be evaluated and calculated.

COPYRIGHT © 2017 THEKEY BDMI INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

12

BDMI is a combination of two technologies, i.e. DMI and Blockchain.

Instead of setting up a centralized database for IDV solution THEKEY deploys its DMI System
within the Information Centers of provincial or municipal governments. The biggest
advantage of such deployment is avoidance of duplicate work for data collection, processing
and authentication.
DMI system deployed in different cities focus on processing the centralized acquired data
and mainly includes five modules as indicated hereunder:
1

Data Collection Module

It is based on ETL technology, which enables data extracted from different data resources,
transformed to a uniformed format and upload to a central site. IDV based on the existed
data can avoid the reduplicative cost on data collection, data processing, analysis and data
verification.
2

Data Standardization Module

Once the data is collected, it needs to be standardized before it can be properly used. In
data standardization module, two sub-modules are important, as indicated below,

Communication Protocol Standardization module.
This module carries out an interactive transmission of the information among different data
systems. When there is an information exchange between different systems, the module will
fulfill the information visit and exchange by standardized communication protocol. The flow
chart below illustrates how this module works.

COPYRIGHT © 2017 THEKEY BDMI INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

13

Term Standardization module.
Each industry has its own terminologies. Even the same term used in different area may refer
to different thing. This module relies on three pillars: ontology, NLP (Nature Language
Processing) and AI (Artificial Interference), to solve this problem and build up the foundation
for data application in diversified scenarios to serve various purposes. The chart below
shows how terminology is standardized under this module.

3

Primary User Index Module

This module is to build up a search dictionary, which can be used to easily find all the
relevant files of every individual. All PII of a given individual will be collected as per his or her
ID/ SSN and the module will organize the data as time-based inveted file. In an inveted file,
the data will be structured as a tree, which contains a primary index, a secondary index and
child indexes. The module categorizes the collected and processed data for IDV into
different level of indexes as defined in advance. When an IDV process is triggered, the input
data will be extracted and searched, if it matches the information in primary index. If the
information matches, it will continue to cross-check the information in secondary index.

15

4

Data Warehouse Solution Module

This module is to ensure all the individual files are properly stored in the data warehouse so
that once an IDV process is trigged, the relevant files can be easily found. The data
warehouse solution will also embrace functions like data input, revise, statistics and retrieval.

5 IDV engine
The main function of the IDV engine is to complete the IDV service in forms of attestation
based on the data exchange platform, which embraces the four modules as described above.
When an IDV process is trigged, the biometric data sent by the user will be verified by the
IDV engine against the biometric data of the same user but authenticated by data stored by
government authorities. The initial verification will be further crosschecked with the latest
behavior and scene data of the given user, received from other validators. Once the IDV
engine is satisfied with the validity of the biometric data sent, the IDV process will continue.
Relevant PII and other metadata will be collected by the IDV engine as requested, and the
result of IDV service will be released in forms of attestation. At the same time, the results of
all previous calculations from every step of IDV will be properly documented by the engine
for regular audit. Personal credit will be evaluated and calculated through the previously
mentioned audit.

As demonstrated above with DMI technology, the centrally collected data could be well
processed, transformed and easy to exchange among different systems. Afterwards, the
data will be encrypted with a hash algorithm in Blockchain for decentralized application.
Data ownership verification, authorization, pricing and payment will all happen on
Blockchain.

Blockchain is a distributed ledger where the data is stored and recorded by different nodes,
which maintain the data and transaction activities. Blockchain uses an asymmetric
cryptographic algorithm, ensuring the data transmission and the safety in utilization, which is
characterized by several features e.g. immutability, irreversibility, security etc. In particular,
smart contracts are realized by programmable scripts, increasing the practicability of
Blockchain. With those features, the application dilemma of identity verification technology
is overcome. The following logical structure map clearly shows how the DMI technology
applies on Blockchain to develop the new revolutionary IDV solution.

17

THEKEY Project team is working on combining DMI technology on Blockchain so that the
following could be delivered:

Individual user would have full
control of their PII information
and KYC standard in each
industry should be followed as
part of Smart Contract when
initiating and processing IDV
request;

All records of PII relevant data
collection and use will be stored
on the Blockchain for auditing in
the future, and to avoid any
misuse;

Blockchain
Technology
To address the requirement of an
IDV result being unaltered and to
avoid catastrophic breakdown,
relevant data currently saved in
centralized servers of various
organizations will be indexed with
identity data block correspondingly
and stored in a distributed way;

Due to the limit of storage size
on Blockchain, an alternative
option is to save PII data in the
ETL database of the Validator in
THEKEY Ecosystem, and save the
hash value of the underlying data
on Blockchain.

The BDMI framework can be divided into three different layers - protocol, interface and

application as shown below.
The protocol layer is set up based on Blockchain, which is applicable for BDMI technical
selection, such as ETH, EOS, NEO etc. This layer sets the safety level, data authority,
concurrency and flow processing.
The interface layer provides identification data modeling by which the protocol layer can be
connected with applications, to realize data standardization, anti-fraud modeling and smart
contract trigger etc.
The application layer will realize the scenarios where identification can be used, where
interface and SDK (Software Development Kit) shall be provided for the data exchange.

Once the user goes to hospital, s/he uses his or her finger print

or face to make the payment instruction through the registered APP
which triggers an IDV request.
3

In response to the user’s payment instruction the hospital will

send the prescription as the claim, via the registered APP of the user,
to medical insurance agency.
4

THEKEY will first make comparison between the biometric data

from the user and the biometric data authenticated and stored by
medical insurance administration agency.
5

Once THEKEY is satisfied with the consistency on the first

checkpoint as described above, THEKEY will further crosscheck with
the latest information collected from other institutions, like public
security agencies, telecommunication and internet companies,
among many others. This is to assess 1) if the user is still alive, and 2)
if s/he still enjoys the entitlement of medical insurance.
6

Once the user has been proven to be eligible for medical

insurance， THEKEY will then collect all other relevant information

for authenticity, eligibility, compliance and rationality checks against
the claim submitted. Once the medical insurance administration is
satisfied with those checks, the payment will be approved.
7

The results of the above calculation will all be properly

documented after the transaction is completed for regular audit.

8

In the audit, credit of both user and hospital will be evaluated,

calculated and documented, as per the anti-fraud, abuse and waste
policies of the medical insurance administration agency. Criteria from
other industry like financial industry, telecommunication, fintech
companies are also used, on pilot basis, for personal credit
evaluation.

Although we have already made substantial progress
in IDV industry, our existing IDV solution is only
applicable in a centralized community at present.
Hence, as mentioned above, we are planning to
improve our IDV solution by introducing Blockchain
technology. Blockchain offers a compelling solution
to the problem of combining accessibility with
privacy and security. Records can be held securely,
using

encryption,

and

referenced and documented in a

dealing with highly sensitive or classified information
in a way that still enforces all the privacy and
confidentiality rights that consumers and regulators
expect. Moreover, Blockchain technology will also
help us to establish an ecosystem, through smart
contract and digital currency, so that all participants

With

THEKEY ECOSYSTEM AND TKY TOKEN

Along with the development of second-generation IDV solution, facilitated by token sales,
THEKEY Project team intends to develop THEKEY Ecosystem for providing IDV service (the
"Ecosystem"). The THEKEY Ecosystem will be a decentralized autonomy community, which
will consist of three components of participants, (Validator, Service Provider and Individual
User) Smart Contracts and TKY Tokens. The objectives of setting up THEKEY Ecosystem are, 1)
to develop a healthy environment where PII can be properly used and protected, 2) to
provide financial incentive to the participants in the Ecosystem.

THEKEY Ecosystem
+ Ecosystem Participants
There are three parties in THEKEY Ecosystem: (1) Validators who process the IDV request and
generate the IDV result, (2) Service Providers who initiate IDV request and (3) Individual
Users who are the customer of the service provider and need to give consent to validators to
process the IDV request. Among others, the Validators are the backbone in the Ecosystem.
The Validators may include THEKEY, government entities, financial institutions and utility
companies among many others. Since THEKEY is already an IDV service provider trusted by
the parties concerned, it is easier to obtain data needed for IDV service from other sources,

including highly sensitive data from government agencies as well as the data like medical
records from hospitals. It is, therefore, an important node or an important validator in a
decentralized IDV ecosystem. It is however not the only node or Validator in the Ecosystem.
Once Validators receive an IDV request against a User from Service Providers, together with
consent of the same user in forms of Smart Contracts, they will process the IDV request and
generate result. After that, they are able to 'stamp' their approval on the Blockchain.

COPYRIGHT © 2017 THEKEY BDMI INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

26

Smart Contracts will play an important role in THEKEY Ecosystem. Before an IDV service is
provided, various Smart Contracts need to be signed off by all parties concerned,
including Validators, Individual Users and Service Providers who are seeking IDV service
against the same user. Smart contracts will have “built-in” government rules,
regulations as well as KYC (Know Your Customer) policies of different industries. The
built-in policies of governments and industries will not only make a healthier Ecosystem
but also save customer time for confirming what PII can be used every time when IDV
service is needed.

Smart contracts can also enable the transactions among the Validators, Users and Service
Providers. With Individual User’s consent, Validators will provide with IDV service to
the Service Provider who makes such request. Service Provider, subject to applicable
KYC policies, can choose among the Validators for what hierarchy of PII and data source
it requires to serve its specific IDV purpose. The price for providing tailor-made IDV
service will be adjusted by the Validators.

Such transaction will conclude in smart

contract among the Individual Users, Validators and Service Providers.

THEKEY token (“TKY Token”), another major component of the Ecosystem, is the only
method to settle smart contracts signed between the participants in THEKEY Ecosystem.
Once the Validator, Service Provider and the Individual User all sign-off on the

COPYRIGHT © 2017 THEKEY BDMI INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

27

transaction via the smart contract, the concerned parties will use TKY Tokens to settle the
contract according to the agreed price and payment sharing plan. TKY Tokens would not
only be obtained by purchasing in token sale events, but will also be able to be earned.
Individual Users, Service Providers and Validators could perform valuable actions in
THEKEY Ecosystem to earn TKY Tokens.

For example, when government authorities,

hospitals and other Service Providers or Validators provide with valuable data in the
Ecosystem subject to Individual User consent, TKY Tokens could be gained and shared
among the data providers and Individual Users. In addition, the credit obtained by current
users who are using our first generation IDV product could convert their credits to TKY
Tokens and spend in THEKEY Ecosystem.

TKY Tokens will be frequently used in THEKEY Ecosystem. After having TKY Tokens, the
Individual Users can use them to purchase identity-related products and services that will
be developed at later stage from THEKEY, such as service to run personal background
check or access to individual credit reports, etc. Service Providers will pay TKY Tokens to
Validators to purchase IDV service. Other Validators will also make their identity-related
products and services available through the Ecosystem. Moreover, THEKEY will also use
TKY Tokens for paying to other Validators or data providers when collecting data to
enhance the overall accuracy, comprehensively and completeness of PII for IDV processing.

Compared to other existing tokens or even fiat currencies, the unreplacable function of the
dedicated token, Key Tokens, in Key Ecosystem includes that ,
• It can be used for cross-border payment easily;
• It can be used for the smart contracts generated in Key Ecosystem;
• It is fractionally divisible.

A certain portion of TKY Tokens will become liquid during the token sale to help promote
THEKEY Ecosystem.
transferable.

Like other cryptocurrencies, units of TKY Tokens are fungible and

The ledger will provide a secure mechanism for owners to transfer TKY

Tokens to other participants and TKY Tokens are expected to trade on cryptocurrency
exchanges in near future. With the development and expansion of THEKEY Ecosystem, as
more and more participants in THEKEY Ecosystem are using TKY Tokens for IDV service, the
core value of TKY Tokens could be realized.

The main features for IDV service process in THEKEY Ecosystem are below:

• Individual users are always in full control his or her PII.

An individual user will use

biometric data, such as fingerprints or face through THEKEY App or device installed at the
service providers, to confirm his or her consent for validators to process the IDV request
which is sent by the Service Provider. No process will be continued unless the individual
user makes such confirmation.

• Specific requirements on PII data in the IDV request will be reviewed against the KYC
standard policy of different industry before processing IDV requests.

Aside from the

confirmation from individual users, validators will also check the eligibility of the IDV
request. For example, an IDV request sent out by a hotel containing the information on
individual users certain medical history might be rejected, as it is not compliant with hotel
KYC industry standards. However, the same request from a medical insurance company
may be considered and accepted.

• Individual user does not need to upload his or her PII. Validators will collect requested
data accordingly after ratification of the first two items above.

• Not one, but three sets of data of PII will be used during the process of IDV conducted by
THEKEY via BDMIs technology.

IDV service of THEKEY is a result of real-time cross-

checking, between identity data, behavior data as well as scene data of a given user.

Identity data are from government authorities, behavior data are usually from financial
institutions and utility companies among many others, whilst scene data are normally from
service providers who are seeking for IDV service. For example, an IDV result as per a
request from a hotel in Hong Kong at 9:00 am is positive, one hour later, the IDV result
based on a request from another hotel based in the United States against by the same user
might be negative, as there is some conflict in the Scene data for the given user. It is
difficult to obtain all the data required from various data sources, and get them ready in
advance at one point for a particular IDV service. It is equally difficult to provide such IDV
service via a centralized service system. It is now possible, however, through Blockchain
technology, to use those highly sensitive data for an IDV service widely and openly, while
PII of users are well protected. Every data source/validator in a decentralized IDV
environment is a node of the chain.

Consider an example case for IDV process in THEKEY Ecosystem. When an individual user
who is living in Beijing needs to be identified, such as for the purchasing of medical
insurance in Singapore, the insurance company will trigger a request for IDV service and
start a 8-step-journey as follows,

1

The insurance company, as the service provider triggers off an IDV request including

certain medical-use history of the given individual user;
2

The user accepts the IDV request by using his or her fingerprint through THEKEY APP

or the equipment of the insurance company, and also signs off the relevant Smart Contract
between the insurance company, THEKEY and the user.
3

THEKEY will review the IDV data request sent by the service provider against the KYC

policy of the relevant industry to justify if the requested data is reasonable.

4

THEKEY will make comparisons between fingerprint data sent and the relevant data

validated by the government, and then cross check the latest ID data, behavior data as well
as Scene data of the given user. These are all automatically settled through encrypted
interfaces.
5

Once THEKEY is satisfied with the validity of user’s ID, IDV will continue. Relevant PII

and other metadata will be collected as defined by the Smart Contract. THEKEY will stamp
its approval on Blockchain as the verification result so that the medical insurance company
can use it.
6

The Smart Contract will be settled by TKY Tokens.

7

At the same time, all previous calculations will be documented for future data audit.

8 The credit of the user and the medical insurance company will be regularly evaluated
and calculated through the above-mentioned data audit.

Such IDV process above would significantly reduce the cost but enhance the accuracy and
reliability for the medical insurance company, which will help reduce insurance premiums.

THEKEY 的未来

In the case that you want to purchase life or medical insurance, you can choose to join a
mutual insurance organization, or choose a large insurance company. You can give certain
access permissions to the insurance organization, which it will base an appropriate
insurance package for you. The insuring, underwriting and claim settlement are all based
on your electric identity on THEKEY Ecosystem, and controlled by smart contracts.

Moreover, you can sell your own personal data to insurance companies for actuarial
purposes, which can decrease the insurance premium you need to pay. This is also realized
via smart contracts in the THEKEY Ecosystem.

Every aspect of life is in need of IDV based on BDMI technology i.e. security check, access
permission, medical treatment and shopping, etc. The existence of THEKEY Ecosystem will
make the internet and the real identity integrated together to facilitate your life.

The team members all have significant achievements in software industry, and have
been in charge of the well-known projects in government affairs, finance, healthcare and
internet industry respectively. Transformed from the traditional IT technology, the team
constitutes first generation blockchain developer in China.
The team has worked on the industry solution design and POC of consortium
blockchain in corporation with Hyperledger since 2015, and below are the main
achievements:

1

Based on Fabric Hyperledger, the team has optimized more than half of the code,
and completed the encapsulation of underlying technical products, which solved the
main issues of privacy, data security, control, management and business efficiency.
Based on intelligent networking technology, Elliptic curve cryptography and
Byzantine Consensus Algorithm, the solution has the ability to quickly build apps on
top, which can cover most application scenarios of large-scale users. It can also
provide a high performance service of 3000 transactions per second, as well as
secure private key access services, and the multiple privacy protection schemes. The
team obtained 1 patent, 21 copyrights and developed 4 products related with
blockchain.

2

The first provider of Blockchain - Government affair in China. Interconnected the
data from different government agencies by applying decentralized network,
distributed ledger, as well as the private and public key mechanism. Reconstructed
the standards and interfaces of the electronic certificate catalogue system.
Redefined the granularity and formats of the certificate data in order to utilize the
data flexibly. The blockchain electronic certificate platform has been implemented in
Nanjing, which connected the individual and legal entities’ data from a dozen of
government agencies and 1600 government affairs. By the main portal of Nanjing
“internet + government affairs”, namely “Nanjing on my hand”, citizens and
companies can manage the government affairs such as house purchase entitlement
examination with one click.

3

Apply and test the self-encapsulated underlying technical products of consortium
blockchain in multiple industries. For example, blockchain + credit ecosystem has
secured the data share among credit institutions; blockchain + sharing economy
ensured the separation of Real Right and the Right to Use; blockchain + copyright
anti – counterfeit solution solved the tracability and credibility issues, and can also
increase the efficiency of copyright trading; blockchain + smart healthcare can
better utilize EMR and genetic big data.
