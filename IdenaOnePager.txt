Idena
Idena is the first human-centric blockchain driven by
proof-of-person consensus. Every node is linked to one
single person with equal voting power.

Unique human identity is the most needed and most dangerous concept in
governance
The ‘3.5% rule’: a coordinated small minority of as low as 3.5% of people can bring a systemic change in
the interconnected world.
1 person = 1 vote: State-of-the-art governance in permissionless systems (DAOs) can only be based on
capital (stake). The missing part is a global democratic governance mechanism based on online
formalization of unique human identity with strong protection against fakes and collusions.
Big Brother reality: The main challenge for global identity is that external verifiers (social media,
biometrics, passports) are based on personal data, which leads to the loss of privacy of people in favor
of states and corporations.

Cryptoidentity
Cryptoidentity is a unique globally verifiable censorship-resistant identity that does not directly refer to
its owner. In a way it is similar to Bitcoin that does not refer to any real world assets or value, but is the
value in itself.
The Idena protocol implements cryptoidentity based on a global ceremony where users verify their
existence by doing a common sense test at the same time across the globe.
