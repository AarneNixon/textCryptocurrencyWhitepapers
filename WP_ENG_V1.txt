The Energy Efficiency market is a complex financial system.
Thanks to EFFORCE this market will become easily accessible to everyone for the first time.
The linking between the financing partners and those in need of investments to improve the energy
efficiency of their structures is made possible by Energy Service Companies (E.S.Co).
Through Energy Performance Contracts (EPC), these structured companies are able to generate
returns on initial investments: energy efficiency translates into savings in bills for the beneficiaries.
The EFFORCE platform solves the three main problems of the energy efficiency market: the
difficulty of putting contributors and Savers in contact, the size of the investments required and the
type of financial return.
Through EFFORCE, energy saving financed by the contributor (Contributor) is tokenized and used
or sold to energy-intensive consumers (Consumers), who can thus stop paying their bills, forever!

1. Introduction

1.1 Energy efficiency
In energy engineering, the term energy efficiency indicates the ability of a physical system to
obtain a given result using less energy than other so-called “lower efficiency” systems, generally
increasing the yield and thus allowing energy savings and a reduction in operating costs.
More than 68% of the energy used in the world is NOT covered by an efficient energy standard
and the system within which it is used could be made more efficient. Just consider that most of the
growth in the demand for energy coming from the cooling of habitable environments takes place in
those parts of the world where there is no regulation to support the energy saving process.
Technological innovation is creating new opportunities for progress in terms of efficiency.
Digitization is profoundly changing the energy sector, just as innovation begins to have a significant
impact on energy efficiency.
In 2016, the world continued to generate more and more value from its energy consumption. In
the same year, the global Energy Intensity, i.e. the amount of primary energy demand needed to
produce a unit of gross domestic product (GDP) generated, decreased by 1.8%, resulting in a socalled “energy bonus” of USD 2.2 trillion. This is twice the entire Australian economy.

1.1 Energy efficiency

11

The energy efficiency system
is deeply changing the way
we consume energy.
Consider that from 2000 to date, the world would have consumed 12% more energy without energy
efficiency. A figure that equates to turning off Europe for a year.

Not only that: in addition to environmental benefits, improving energy efficiency also leads to
increased security. In fact, many countries have avoided additional expenses and risks related to
energy imports.

1.1 Energy efficiency

12

Thanks to the energy
efficiency achieved:
From 2000 to 2016, Japan imported 20% less oil and 23% less natural gas than it would have done
in the same period without energy efficiency interventions.
Germany and the United Kingdom, which correspond to the largest gas markets in Europe, have
achieved a reduction in imports of natural gas from Russia equal to 30% of the European total.
Short-term energy security has improved, as energy efficiency has reduced the daily gas demand
peak. This means that imports have not been reduced on an annual basis, but in the periods of
greatest demand.

1.2 The E.S.Co model
and the EPC
EFFORCE is a blockchain-based energy saving trading platform.
The platform brings together those who want to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings or
industrial processes with a pool of contributors interested in being repaid in tokens representing the
energy savings achieved.
This method of implementing the energy efficiency market for the first time makes a particularly
complex energy-financial system simple and accessible.
Thanks to EFFORCE any economic entity that wishes to implement solutions on its energy
systems, be they industrial processes or buildings, will be able to negotiate part of its energy
savings directly with Consumers or Contributors. Through the tokenization of the energy saved, it
will be possible to guarantee liquidity and extend access to capital investment.
To optimize the cycle of financing and access to capital, EFFORCE allows the tokenization of
energy savings.
It represents a contractual mechanism between companies that want to improve the efficiency
of their processes and energy consumers. The proposed model is the same as that of Energy
Service Companies (E.S.Co) which, through Energy Performance Contracts (EPC), manage to
obtain positive economic returns against an initial investment in energy efficiency projects.
This contractual form makes it possible to channel financial investments into projects for the
redevelopment and performance improvement of an energy system, be it an industrial plant or a
building, owned by a third party (Beneficiary).
The value of energy savings deriving from the intervention is shared between the
E.s.Co, which made the investment and implemented the redevelopment process, and the
Beneficiary. The E.s.Co uses its own energy saving quota to make a return on the investment,
while the Beneficiary sees its energy expenses decrease.
Energy Performance Contracts allow the savings deriving from lower energy consumption to
be divided between the party that improved the performance of the efficiency- improved energy
system (the E.s.Co) and the party benefitting from the energy efficiency intervention
(the Beneficiary).

1.2 The E.S.Co model and the EPC

14

The way it works is extremely linear from a financial point of view, but decidedly
more complex from a technical-implementation point of view:

1

Before carrying out an energy efficiency
project, any entity that owns an energy system
pays its bill to a private or
state-owned supplier of electricity and gas.

2

The E.S.Co evaluates the energy systems
owned by the Beneficiary and implements
them, in order to invest its financial resources
in redevelopment interventions or energy efficiency improvement of plants
or buildings.

3

For the entire duration of the contract, the
Beneficiary pays a part of the energy savings
generated to the E.s.Co. This gives a return on
the initial investment.

1.2 The E.S.Co model and the EPC

15

4

At the end of the contract, the Beneficiary can
take full advantage of the savings and the technology installed.

5

The financial investment is fully borne by the
E.S.Co. The Beneficiary obtains an immediate
guaranteed reduction of energy costs and, at
the end of the contract, benefits from a new
and already installed efficiency improvement
intervention.

The greater the energy savings obtained by the Beneficiary, the greater the returns for the Esco
and the Contributors, since the savings generated are the actual financial performance of the initial
investment.

Therefore, the goal is common:
using and managing the plant in the best way
possible to maximize its advantages.

1.2 The E.S.Co model and the EPC

16

2. EFFORCE

2.1 The problem
of energy efficiency
If one thinks of the constant increase in the demand for energy, the construction of power plants
and chimneys often comes to mind. Many do not consider that it is much cheaper and more
ecological, on the other hand, to reduce energy consumption.
Unfortunately, however, access to the energy efficiency market is hampered by a number of
factors, including:
•

The high initial costs. Accessing a complex energy efficiency system requires a minimum
investment of 200,000 euros.

•

The need for technical knowledge of the functioning of energy systems and smart meters to
monitor the energy savings achieved.

•

The lack of trust and a meeting place between those who need to implement the investment to
improve the energy efficiency of their structure and those who actually want to invest in order to
obtain alternative returns.

•

The inability of one of the parties to evaluate in a technical manner the actual savings
achievable thanks to the efficiency improvement intervention.

•

The limited technical knowledge of the sector on the part of financial institutions, which are
not able to calculate the returns on the investments made. Moreover, the E.S.Cos do not have
access to the capital channel as a financial institution.

•

Uncertainty on the pay-back period of the investment.

Addressing these problems is necessary, also in view of reaching the economic development
defined by the World Bank, which aims to guarantee access to sustainable, reliable, and modern
energy for all. One of the salient points of this development will be to double the overall rate of
energy efficiency improvement by 2030.

2.1 The problem of energy efficiency

17

2.2 Vision: EFFORCE
EFFORCE is the first blockchain-based platform that connects the demand and supply of energy
efficiency investments.
Through EFFORCE, anyone wishing to attract investments to make energy improvements to their
buildings or industrial processes can easily do so by registering their request on the platform.
The EFFORCE team will validate the request and develop, together with the company, the energy
efficiency improvement project, evaluating the necessary investment, the annual internal rate of
return (IRR) and thus concluding an Energy Performance Contract (EPC).
For example, for the energy redevelopment of an industrial shed, it may be necessary to:
•

Replace the lighting system.

•

Insulate the walls and roof.

•

Improve the heating and cooling system to make it suitable for the needs of the building,
exploiting and recovering as much as possible the heat cycle generated by the production
process itself, through heat recovery.

An intervention of this magnitude could lead to an IRR of 38% on the investment for the 7-year
duration of the EPC contract.
It may be that the company does not have the technical knowledge to implement these solutions,
or that it does not want to access the banking channel in order not to increase its debt exposure
towards banks. Or the company may even want to share its renovation intentions with its
customers, involving them in the corporate image improvement project.
To overcome these problems, the company can use EFFORCE to look for the necessary
crowdfunding to proceed with the energy redevelopment projects, in exchange for sharing the
savings generated.

2.2 Vision: EFFORCE

18

All those wishing to invest in energy efficiency projects through a secure and decentralized
blockchain-based system will also have access to EFFORCE.
The role of the blockchain is fundamental, since it guarantees the integrity and uniqueness of the
energy saving data obtained. The data that each smart meter will transmit will be validated and
certified by the blockchain, so as to be able to unequivocally guarantee the savings obtained at a
certain point in time and, therefore, the quantity of KWh saved which will be loaded on the user
profile of the contributor (the so-called “Contributor”).
The energy savings of each contributor will be tokenized and can be used both to offset energy
consumption and to be traded.

“

EFFORCE will allow each Contributor
to be an active part of an E.S.Co that works with
qualified counterparties, in order to obtain energy
savings to be sold or used to reduce the costs
of their energy bill.

2.2 Vision: EFFORCE

19

3. Business Model

3.1 Energy Saving
Tokenization
The main objective of any economic entity interested in improving the energy efficiency of its
systems, be their industrial processes or buildings, is to optimize its cash flows.
EFFORCE allows such entities to rapidly be connected with those who are interested in purchasing
the energy savings resulting from the implementation of such projects, without the use of equity.
Through the tokenization of the energy saved, a liquid and transparent market is created,
guaranteed by the blockchain and accessible to all.
To optimize the cycle of financing and access to capital, EFFORCE tokenizes energy savings.
Tokenizing energy savings represents a contractual mechanism between companies that want to
improve the efficiency of their processes and the community.
The innovative tokenization model has been clarified by the European regulator. It is structured as
a reward-based crowdfunding, where Contributors are rewarded with free energy savings that they
can keep, sell or use to offset their energy consumption.
The EFFORCE platform was built to change the way energy savings are generated and
redistributed globally. After years of experience in the energy efficiency market, the EFFORCE
team was able to identify its limits.
First, the enormous waste of energy due to the lack of an efficient system. Just consider that the
energy demand for cooling habitable environments is greater in those parts of the world that lack
regulation to support energy efficiency processes.
The second problem is the difficulty in bringing together capital and the energy saving sector. The
high number of intermediaries and parties involved even only partially in the efficiency process
is the cause of the increase in implementation costs, pay-back periods and even delays in the
physical execution of projects.

3.1 Energy Saving Tokenization

20

3.2 The role of the
blockchain and the
Energy Performance
Smart Contract
Through EFFORCE, energy end Consumers can participate in tokenized energy savings.
Thanks to the control system and data certification guaranteed by the blockchain,
EFFORCE has created the first Energy Performance Smart Contract.
Each EFFORCE token holder will be granted with the access with priority to the energy savings
projects that will be listed in the platform, contributing to the spreading of energy efficiency on a
global scale. Each project will have a wallet in which the amount of KWh saved from that project
will be accrued. In this way each token will accumulate the KWh of energy saving achieved.
These savings derive from the efficiency improvement projects with high financial returns carried
out by reliable industrial and commercial partners.

Through a global network of connections, the data indicating the energy savings is recorded and
guaranteed by control units, such as smart meters, already widely used for calculating the energy
efficiency achieved.
This is a way of tracking both the work carried out and the result obtained in an unequivocal and
timely manner.

3.2 The role of the blockchain

21

The transparency and reliability of the blockchain, in addition to clarifying a system currently
characterized by information asymmetry, involves the community, involving it in the efforts and
results related to the various efficiency improvement projects financed.
An Energy Performance Smart Contract guarantees the savings obtained over a certain period of
time of a specific energy efficiency project.
The energy savings generated become a tangible asset in the hands of token holders, who may
decide to sell them or use them to reduce their electricity bills. Furthermore, 1% of the energy
savings obtained in this way and certified by the Energy Performance Smart Contract are donated
and distributed among all EFFORCE Contributors, thus increasing the value of their tokens also at
a nominal level.

“

In other words, through EFFORCE,
the energy savings of a third party are
tokenized and can be used by everyone.

3.2 The role of the blockchain

22

Efforce securitizes
energy savings.
This is the innovation that can revolutionize
the energy efficiency market.

3.2 The role of the blockchain

23

3.3 Contributor, Saver
and Consumer
There are 3 players involved in the EFFORCE platform: Contributor, Saver and Consumer.
The Contributors are those who access the auction mechanism through the EFFORCE platform
to purchase the future savings generated by efficiency improvement projects and guaranteed by
smart contracts. The tokens held will give priority to the investment.
The Savers are the owners of industries, transport systems, buildings and other energy systems
that benefit from efficiency improvement projects and use part of the energy savings obtained to
their advantage, thus reducing the need to purchase energy.
The Consumers are those who want to buy the energy savings generated by third parties to offset
and ultimately eliminate their electricity bills.
Furthermore, at least 1% of all energy savings obtained are donated and redistributed
among all EFFORCE token holders forever!

This allows energy
savings (and not energy)
to circulate among
the Savers and the
Consumers.

3.3 Contributor, Saver e Consumer

24

3.4 Using the
Energy Performance
Smart Contract
All holders of EFFORCE tokens will be able to take part in the efficiency improvement projects
in which they invest through the subscription of Energy Performance Smart Contracts, which
represent the saving of 1 KWh of energy saved at a given future time.
Through smart contracts, certified savings allow Contributors to hold tokens representing the
savings generated. In this way, the company is able to sell the energy savings that can be obtained
in advance, thus financing the implementation of the efficiency improvement on its production plant
or on its residential building.
Each energy efficiency project proposed by Savers must contain the following information:

1

The costs

2

The percentage of savings shared with Contributors
through the Energy Performance Smart Contract

3

The duration of the Energy Performance Smart Contract

4

The amount of savings generated

5

The duration of the auction period

6

The intrinsic return of the operation

3.4 Using the Energy Performance Smart Contract

25

In this way, each Saver in possession of EFFORCE tokens can participate in these auctions to
invest in Energy Performance Smart Contracts and thus accumulate the savings obtained.
Furthermore, at least 1% of all energy savings obtained are donated and redistributed among all
EFFORCE token holders forever!
The Contributors will have the right to access the auctions to support innovative energy efficiency
projects, obtaining in return the energy savings generated. They can also decide whether to use
them to reduce their consumption, or to sell them to Consumers, who will have significant interest
in buying the savings of others, rather than paying their energy costs. The order of access to
new efficiency improvement projects and the consequent collection of the related energy savings
depend on the number of tokens held by the Contributor.

“

Furthermore, at least 1% of all energy savings
obtained are donated and redistributed among
all EFFORCE token holders forever!

3.4 Using the Energy Performance Smart Contract

26

3.5 Using Token
for Energy Efficiency
Each token represents an Energy Performance Smart Contract, which guarantees the savings
obtained over a certain period of time, thanks to a specific energy efficiency project.
The energy savings generated become a tangible asset held by token holders, who may decide to
sell them or use them to reduce their electricity bills.
Tokens representing energy savings can therefore be used to reduce their energy costs.
Through the wallet, the energy savings obtained over time can be kept and spent to reduce their bill
whenever the price of electricity is such as to be convenient for offsetting.
Moreover, all Consumers can purchase energy savings to offset their energy costs. In fact, it will be
increasingly viable to improve the energy process of an inefficient system and to enjoy part of the
savings obtained, rather than paying the high energy costs.

3.5 Using Token for Energy Efficiency

27

3.6 Business Case
AitherCO2 funded the intervention concerning the installation of blended winglets on twenty
aircrafts of the fleet of an Italian charter operator with an EPC.
Blended winglets are wingtip extensions that improve the performance of the aircraft by reducing
induced drag and consequently reducing fuel consumption. The induced drag decreases as the
speed of the aircraft increases, since it is the result of the shape of the advancing vehicle.
Part of this induced drag stems from the lift generated by the wings. The static pressure above
the wing is lower than that under the wing. The pressure is equal only at the ends of the wings,
provided that the profile allows the total air pressures above and below the wing to be equalled.

The profile of the classic wing is specifically designed to allow this event in the direction of motion,
but at the tip it does not allow the reunification of the two flows in a homogeneous manner,
creating turbulence and, consequently, an increase in induced drag. This requires additional work
on the engines to bring the aircraft to the correct flight speed and height, thereby increasing fuel
consumption.
Blended winglets reduce induced drag, making it easier to move the aircraft and decreasing the
effort of the engines, which will be able to reach the same speed and flight altitude as a similar
aircraft without winglets, saving fuel consumption.

3.6 Business Case

28

An aircraft with blended winglets is able to save 8% of Jet A1 Fuel compared to an aircraft without
them.
The measure of the energy savings derives from the difference in specific fuel consumption before
and after installation of the blended winglets. This data is obtained by default from the on-board
instrumentation, since it is essential to prepare the flight plan and decide the amount of fuel to be
loaded.
The company has a fleet of 20 Airbus A380s. The tank capacity is 350 tons of Jet A1 Fuel each for
a total of 7000 tons of Jet A1 consumed each time the fleet is filled up.

With 2 fills per week and an estimated
JET A1 cost of USD 1000/ton, the
customer’s annual savings during the
first two years of execution of the EPC
contract amounted to USD 220 million
and saved the environment 2.3M tons
of CO2.

Principles of Tokenomics

Consumers initiate the fundraising for a particular energy efficiency project

Contributors would participate with a stable coin into a specific energy efficiency project;
their holding of EFFORCE tokens will be used as the criterion to decide the allocation of
the contribution proportion of the project (e.g. on a pro-rata basis)

Savers implement the energy efficiency projects with the raised capital

The energy saving achieved from the projects will be mainly distributed to the Contributors
and the Savers

The interest stakes in the energy savings of the projects could be traded on the EFFORCE
platform

At least 1% of the total energy savings achieved from all the projects will be distributed to
all EFFORCE Token holders
Dual Token model (stable coin and EFFORCE token): The stable coin is used as project
operating capital and the EFFORCE Token would function as a Utility token to represent
the platform rights and incentives

4.1 Token Function
WOZX Role and its intrinsic value
The EFFORCE Token (WOZX) is a Utility token that functions as the certificate of the energy-saving project initiation and cooperation by Consumers and Savers with EFFORCE.
Tokens will be released according to the Lock-up policy.
EFFORCE Token (WOZX) will function as the privilege qualification of well pursued energy-saving
projects.
e.g.: Contributors who want to take part in energy-saving projects on the platform may be required to lock 1 token for each 1 USDT of contribution. This mechanism would enjoy the potential to
activate a huge market by certain locking requirement rate, such as 1 EFFORCE token:10 USDT,
which of course would vary from project to project according to market situation and the decision of
the project team.
At least 1% of total energy savings achieved of all the projects will be distributed to all EFFORCE
Token holders. The percentage could be adjusted as decided through the governance mechanism
of EFFORCE platform.
EFFORCE Token holders may use their tokens as rights and interests such as voting rights for the
general governance, such as the ratio of redistribution of energy savings, etc.
The token can be used to stimulate the whole platform ecology.

Incentives for mining
According to the TOKEN DISTRIBUTION MODEL, up to 200,000,000 EFFORCE tokens (WOZX)
will be used to incentivize the Contributors, the Consumers, the Savers and anyone who
introduces, contributes to and takes part into the energy-saving projects on the platform.
Mining is initiated when energy-saving projects are launched successfully and rewards will be
degressive every year.
The releasing plan is spanned in 10 years according to the following timeline:
25% of the tokens allocated for incentives will be released in the first year, half of that amount during the second year and then degressively each year further.
The principle for distributing incentives will depend on the nature of the incentive.
Major partners, such as global energy saving institutions, savers, data auditing institutions and PR
companies, will be eligible to receive MAJOR PARTNERS SING-UP INCENTIVE, once qualified
cooperation agreement is achieved.
This kind of incentive shall not represent more than 30% of the total amount of tokens released for
mining every year.
Contributors of the energy efficiency projects can receive the FUNDING PARTNERS
CONTRIBUTION INCENTIVE. This kind of incentive shall not represent more than 70% of the total
amount of tokens released for mining every year.

Token diagram
The scheme below shows the role of the EFFORCE token and how it will affect the whole
eco-system. The circulation of the Token is enhanced by the use of the Platform as a major tool for
Energy Efficiency.

The usage and tranding demand would increase with the scale-up of the quality projects. And EFFORCE token would
appreciate accordingly. The core of the EFFORCE tokenomics is to attract more quality energy saving projects, and
therefore to increase the value of the ecosystem and reduce the liquid token in the market, and to achieve the goal to
increase energy eﬃciency for the whole planet.

6. Road Map

6.1 First steps
According to a study published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), investments in energy
efficiency increased by 9% in 2017. This growth rate remained constant and in the same year the
energy efficiency market reached a record value of USD 231 billion.
More than 68% of the energy used in the world is NOT covered by an efficient energy standard
and the system within which it is used could be made more efficient. Suffice it to consider that most
of the growth in the demand for energy coming from the cooling of habitable environments takes
place in those parts of the world where there is no regulation to support the energy saving process.

For this reason, we want to make investment in energy efficiency fluid
and accessible. In fact, the current system is hampered by a number
of factors:
•

Need for a minimum investment of 200,000 euros to access a complex energy efficiency
system.

•

Technical knowledge of the functioning of energy systems and smart meters to monitor the
energy savings achieved.

•

The lack of trust and a meeting place between those who need to implement the investment to
improve the energy efficiency of their structure and those who actually want to invest in order to
obtain alternative returns.

•

Uncertainty on the pay-back period of the investment.

•

The limited technical knowledge of the sector on the part of financial institutions, which are
not able to calculate the returns on the investments made. Moreover, the E.S.Cos do not have
access to the capital channel as a financial institution.

6.1 First steps

45

The first aim of EFFORCE is to build a platform that brings together supply and demand,
simplifying the investment method and making it more secure. Thanks to EFFORCE, contributors
will always have access to clear information on the IRR and the pay-back period of their
investments.
Thanks to the proceeds deriving from the Presale phase, EFFORCE can be the first platform for
bringing together energy efficiency supply and demand.
In this initial phase, the focus will be on engineering and building the foundations of the first
decentralized energy efficiency platform. The initial phase will end as soon as it will be possible to
invest and disinvest in energy efficiency projects.

“

EFFORCE eliminates these information
asymmetries, making the investment
process more transparent and accessible.

6.1 First steps

46

Q1 2020: Finalizing Platform
Development for Factories
and Real Estate Projects
The platform for bringing together supply and demand and the accounting of energy savings
obtained from the energy efficiency interventions carried out will be operational starting from the
first quarter of 2020.
Until such time, all EFFORCE tokens will be able to be used to purchase environmental services
and consultancy on energy efficiency at AitherCO2.
AitherCO2 will put the first projects that can be implemented on the platform, in order to make the
exchange platform operational also on the supply side.

Among these projects, we would like to highlight two in particular:
•

Energy efficiency project on a dual 8.55MW industrial tri-generation plant located in Italy, with a
total cost of 6,500,000 euros, with an annual IRR of 20% for 7 years.
The term “tri-generation” refers to a particular form of cogeneration that involves the
simultaneous production of three forms of energy starting from a single fuel:
1. power
2. heat
3. cooling
(CHCP = Cogeneration of Heat, Cooling and Power)

6.1 First steps

To these projects will be added those of all the Savers interested in redeveloping their building or
industrial complex in terms of energy efficiency, using crowdfunding to channel the investment
through Energy Performance Smart Contracts.
In this way, EFFORCE will also deal with regulating the supply side, evaluating and proposing
efficiency projects to those interested in investing in an energy efficiency quota.

Consumer side
For Consumers interested in reducing their energy costs, EFFORCE will implement a marketing
campaign in order to reduce its disbursements and channel the interest of small and large buyers
to the market for the purchase of energy savings of others.

6.2 Teen Age
Increase the number of companies interested in receiving energy
efficiency investments through EPC.
In this second phase of geographical and sector expansion, marketing will be increasingly
important, in order to implement energy efficiency projects on: transport, residential and tourism
buildings and complex industrial processes.
Imagine a production company, or simply any residential complex that wants to
improve its energy consumption, attracting the capital needed from all over the world in
cryptocurrencies or in fiat currencies, selling part of the savings obtained from the efficiency
process.

Q1 2021: Road and Marine Transport industry is added to the project
platform
Starting from the first quarter of 2021, we will be able to proceed with the improvement of energy
efficiency of company fleets and shipyards.
