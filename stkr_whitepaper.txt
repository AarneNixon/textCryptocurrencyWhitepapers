Stkr
// A protocol for decentralized
proof-of-stake
infrastructure
By Ankr

// Version 1.0.0
BY ANKR

Abstract

Stkr is a decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) based infrastructure that creates a global
market for computational power and storage. These resources can be combined and
used to carry out any predefined task that requires any capacity (i.e., processing power,
storage, and bandwidth). Unfortunately, today such resources are provided by either
closed networks or central cloud providers.
By using a peer-2-peer mesh network, the Stkr infrastructure offers a practical,
immediately viable alternative that can enable direct payments using ANKR tokens on
Ethereum between users (also called “requesters”) and providers of those resources in
an efficient, environment friendly, and competitive market.
For the initial release (MVP), the infrastructure will utilize Ethereum 2.0 (e.g., full nodes,
wallet providers, exchanges) for staking, but the mission is to expand to all other
significant blockchain platforms as well as conventional systems. Using this approach,
the infrastructure allows users to earn staking rewards based on their ETH and ANKR
holdings without having to maintain an extensive staking infrastructure.
The Stkr infrastructure enables requesters to run nodes for different protocols,
without the need to study any technical documentation or requiring any technical
knowledge. Just plug and play! Further, this platform has a great potential to create
a comprehensive marketplace that fulfills the needs of cloud providers and staking
enthusiasts. The infrastructure ensures quality service provision of node hosting via

// Stkr

management by the Stkr governance.

1 	Introduction

Interest in proof-of-stake (PoS) technology has been growing quite rapidly (e.g., Ethereum 2.0, Tezos,
Dash, Tron, Neo, Cosmos, VeChain, Ontology, Polkadot, Cardano, Kava, Band, Chainlink, Algorand,
Storj, Matic). Ethereum will also soon migrate to Ethereum 2.0 and in doing so will replace proof-of-work
(PoW) with PoS[1, 2, 3]. Also, there exists some PoS based platforms for outsourced computations via
excess computational power of users. We highlight that many computers use less than 5% of their CPU
power the most of the time. However, the main drawback of those PoS based systems is that there is no
usable staking platform to encourage community to be part of the consensus. In fact, we can further list
their crucial drawbacks as follows:
›

Existing staking platforms are assumed to be fully trusted today, but unfortunately are vulnerable to
single-point-of-failure due to centralization. Namely, a corrupted centralized system can easily wipe
out the funds of the users. To prevent such cases, some blockchains have already implemented their
own delegation methods without transferring ownership of user tokens (e.g., Tezos). In this scenario,
the users only delegate rights to validators while the tokens remain under control in their wallets.
However, Ethereum 2.0 does not provide such a delegation process.

›

The existing centralization results in security and privacy issues where the servers can observe
private data, manage rules, and even manipulate every computation.

›

The costs related to centralized servers can force clients to pay higher fees, and this may impede
competition in the market.

›

Staking rewards and their distribution are not transparent (no one knows how much staking rewards
are collected and whether it is distributed fairly.).

›

Distribution parameters for staked rewards among the participants are not transparent (no one can
verify what percentage is received by each party.)

›

There are many people/organizations on the market today that possess large amounts of freecapacity resources and extensive technical expertise to serve while not holding sufficient ETH tokens.
On the other hand, there also exist individuals/organizations who hold a large number of ETH tokens
(either singly or collectively) while not possessing and/or not capable of managing the infrastructure

// Stkr

required to stake effectively.

2 	What the Stkr
infrastructure solves
The Stkr platform features a feature-rich environment specifically designed to facilitate a system where
resource providers and requesters interact. It allows easy deployment of, and staking in, any node,
accessible, affordable, and instantly distributed across the globe. On a very high level, the features of the
Stkr infrastructure can be listed as follows:
›

Stkr will provide the first robust, decentralized, entirely trustless, blockchain staking platform (i.e.,
eliminates single-point-of-failure due to existing centralization issues.). On the Stkr infrastructure,
users will delegate the utilization of their tokens to the Stkr system and providers through threshold
signatures[4, 5]. Namely, the tokens can only be spent if both the Stkr system and providers agree to
sign a transaction. This will eliminate the requiring trust of a single entity, and will protect user funds.

›

The Stkr infrastructure provides complete transparency of collection of rewards as well as fair
distribution of those rewards by means of publicly available smart contracts without relying on a
trusted third party.

›

Stkr aims to create a marketplace which builds a bridge between providers and requesters, and to
allow them to meet on its infrastructure.

›

The system will also help individuals to fully utilize their idle CPUs, GPUs, memory and free storage,
and to earn money from these assets.

›

The system allows payments per use by bringing requesters and providers within a privacy-preserving
pseudo-anonymous platform.

›

The Stkr infrastructure will also allow the concept of “micropool validators” which are composed of
groups of micro investors who have a small amount of ETH (<32 ETH) but collectively hold at least
32 ETH. In this case, the Stkr infrastructure will connect millions of micro-investors in the network to
invest and be part of the ecosystem.

›

Availability and robustness of nodes are significantly enhanced (guaranteeing low downtime risk).

›

The system works in a tokenized manner (through ANKR tokens) to incentivize providers to make
business sustainable. That is, it provides a flexible demand and supply mechanism among many

›

Stkr will begin by supporting ETH nodes, the future goal is to open up to other blockchains.

›

The system as-a-whole has far wider, great potential, to serve various business models beyond
blockchain, as almost any real-life business model requires IT infrastructure and resources.

// Stkr

independent peer-2-peer network nodes.

3 Our architecture
3.1

Entities

The following parties are involved in the Stkr decentralized infrastructure:
›

Stkr Node: an operating system/docker that runs a single Stkr sidecar and a blockchain node (VM/
EVM). A provider can have more than one Stkr node.

›

Stkr Sidecar: software that manages a blockchain node (e.g., availability, capacity, and security).
It also randomly chooses other nodes on the Stkr infrastructure, checks their uptime, and reports
to the smart contracts. Furthermore, any individual can install and execute this software to stake
their ANKR tokens and receive rewards. Furthermore, the stakers on the sidecars are expected to
participate in the voting process. For participating in the voting process, the stakers will get rewards
in ANKR tokens.

›

Requesters: users demand for creating a blockchain node for staking (e.g., Ethereum 2.0).

›

Providers: independent individuals or entities who invest in resource capacity to connect to the
Stkr infrastructure and create new Stkr nodes. Thus, they manage a set of Stkr nodes which are
registered on Ethereum smart contracts to be able to run the blockchain nodes.

›

Government: The Stkr government will consist of 2n + 1 members where n is initially set to a
certain number but can be further updated.
1.

Initialization Phase: n + 1 members (Governors) will initially be invited to participate. These
participants will be highly motivated to participate in the project and the platform with a united
objective to improve the growing utilization, community and promotion of the platform. These
members will be required to stake a certain amount of ANKR tokens to retain membership in
this initial government throughout this phase. They can choose to increase their staked amount
to increase their rewards.

2.

Transition Phase: After a certain period of time (which will be defined during the initialization
phase), the candidate governors, who stake a minimum number of ANKR tokens, can apply
to the Stkr infrastructure to be a governor. An additional n governors will be democratically
chosen from those candidates through an election process. This process is decided through the
number of votes received, where each ANKR token staked by a candidate counts as a single
vote, plus then additional votes can be received from community members who have ANKR
staked in Sidecars (again, one ANKR provides one vote). According to the total amount of
tokens staked by each candidate governor plus votes they received from Sidecars, the first n
candidates are chosen as new governors.

3.

Automated Phase: Periodically, the whole list will be updated according to the Transition Phase.
Each governor (independently from the amount of stake) has an equal weight in voting for
decisions in the platform. In particular, the tasks of the Stkr governors include:
›

providing recommendations

›

defining algorithms of reputation (i.e., the algorithms of the underlying smart contracts)

›

qualifying providers

›

collecting statistics

Whenever a governor does not follow the governance policies, they will be punished. For example,
if governors fail to participate in three consecutive voting processes, their staking will be slashed.
ANKR Staking Users: Users who do not want to stake their ETH, can still stake their ANKR tokens
to the platform. These users can see the list of installed sidecars on the Stkr marketplace, choose
the most profitable one, and stake their ANKR tokens to it. The following rules will be applied for
these users:
›

Users can stake any amount of ANKR tokens to a sidecar which is executed and managed on
the provider side.

›

Users can withdraw their ANKR tokens at any time before a project is completed, however,
in that case they will not get any rewards.

›

Periodically, stakers get rewards from the Reward Pool proportional to their staking amount.

// Stkr

›

7

Hence, the entire system is transparent, reliable, and robust. From the view of users, requesters, and
providers, the platform is indeed decentralized. However, the government mechanism will initially
be semi-decentralized because a set of governments will be chosen during the initialization phase.
In the long term, once the rules and policies are matured enough the system will evolve into a fully
decentralized network.
3.1.1 Calculation of a reputation score
Calculation of reputation scores will depend on the following parameters:
›

Staked amount.

›

Bid price.

›

Average running time of a Stkr node.

›

Average percentage of total uptime of a Stkr node (e.g, 99%).

3.1.2 Onboarding process of a provider
A provider will have the following features:
›

Must run a Stkr sidecar for each Ethereum node and stake a certain amount of ANKR.

›

Set a price (as they wish with a max value).

›

Provide a brand name.

›

Provide on-demand services.

Note that an Ethereum 2.0 node requires to stake at least 32 ETH in order to be a validator. However, the
rewards will not be affected even if more than 32 ETH is staked. In the Stkr infrastructure, each provider
has a reputation score which represents the reliability level of a provider. In this case, we may have the
following cases for staking ETH:
›

Provider is fully trusted: If the provider is fully reliable and trusted, then the provider does not
need to stake any ETH, but in this case, the requesters are required to stake at least 32 ETH. If there
are losses during this staking period, then the requester loss will be compensated by the insurance
pool.

›

Provider is not trusted: If the provider is not trusted, then it should at least stake 16 ETH and the
remaining 16 ETH will be staked by the requester. This prevents the requester’s loss completely
since all the loss can be compensated by the provider’s stake.

›

Provider is semi-trusted: If the trust level of a provider is between the first and second case, then
the provider must stake at least k ETH where k is defined by the government while the requester
is required to stake 32 - k ( k can be different for each provider).

// Stkr

Why shouldn’t a provider stake only ANKR? In the Stkr system, the penalty can only be performed

8

by Ethereum and the loss will be paid in ETH. If a provider stakes only ANKR and the ETH price
increases sharply then the loss may not be compensated by the staked ANKR. Hence, the Stkr
infrastructure will be robust even in case ETH or ANKR prices fluctuate heavily.

3.2 Smart contracts in the Stkr infrastructure
The smart contracts of the Stkr Infrastructure include, but are not limited to:
›

›

Stkr Nodes:
›

Registered nodes with a unique identifier.

›

Current staked ETH and collected rewards.

›

Provider ID and its capacity resource details.

›

How much ETH/ANKR is staked by the providers and the users.

›

Start and finish time of a node.

Marketplace:
›

Matching of requesters and nodes.

›

Assigning a user to be a qualified provider.

›

Managing an auction mechanism for requesters to decide the best offer given by the providers
(e.g., Vickrey auction6).

›

›

›

›

Government:
›

List of governors.

›

Collecting statistics (to monitor the system).

›

Updating policies.

›

Redistributing tokens to requesters.

›

Managing total collected rewards for a user.

›

Managing the distribution of collected rewards in the pools.

Providers:
›

List of providers and their details.

›

Qualifying providers.

›

The reputation score of a provider.

Sidecars:
›

Status of installation of a Stkr node.

›

A sidecar can control only one single blockchain node.

›

A list of blockchain nodes to be checked for uptime.

›

Check the uptime score of other blockchain nodes.

›

The block ID of the latest check for a node.

Requesters:
›

List of users and their details.

›

Total ETH/ANKR staked amount.

Micro-pool:
›

Any provider sends ETH as collateral and executes the micro-pool smart contract to initiate
a new Ethereum node.

›

The provider can specify the end time of staking period.

// Stkr

›

9

›

The provider can add more ETH staking.

›

The provider cannot withdraw staked collateral until the completion of the node.

›

Any user can stake ETH to the smart contract.

›

As soon as the total amount of ETH reaches or exceeds 32 ETH, the provider will start its
validator node immediately.

›

Once the node initiates processing requesters cannot withdraw their stake until completion of
the project.

›

If a provider wants to stop the service for its node (or the service is stopped due to unexpected
reasons) then the government migrates the requesters of that node to another pool.

3.3 The role of ANKR tokens
The platform adds the following utilities to the ANKR token:
›

All payments on the platform are done with ANKR tokens.

›

Requesters require ANKR tokens to pay to the infrastructure in order to initiate the process.

›

Providers are required to stake ANKR tokens as a collateral to become a qualified provider. They
earn rewards (as ANKR tokens) due to staking. If providers become unresponsive, the underlying
smart contract will immediately detect this and they will get slashed from their deposit.

›

A Stkr governor needs to maintain a minimum staked amount of ANKR tokens to retain membership
in the government. Independently from the amount of stake, each governor will have an equal weight
in voting for decisions in the platform.

3.4 The main functionalities of the Stkr infrastructure
At the first stage, the Stkr infrastructure will work on Ethereum 2.0 where the smart contracts are only
limited to ERC20. Before we go into the details, we will briefly describe how the Stkr infrastructure
works. Note that it is a decentralized hosting solution through Ethereum. Any provider can register their
capacity of resources using ANKR tokens and install the Stkr sidecar on each node under their control.
These nodes are evaluated by the government in their approval process as qualified providers. They are
then called “Stkr nodes” of the Stkr infrastructure. Any requester can submit a project proposal to the
Stkr infrastructure by paying some certain amount of ANKR tokens. The Stkr infrastructure evaluates
the proposal, and approves it, if the underlying criteria are met. If an Ethereum 2.0 node is installed as
a validator, both the provider and the requester (or micro investors altogether) must stake at least 32

// Stkr

ETH in total.

10

At the end of a project, the collected profit from that requester node is deposited into a smart contract,
and is distributed to the participants.

3.4.1 Initialization
1.

The Stkr infrastructure is launched by a governor who will publish a policy to qualify a provider (e.g.,
Ethereum slash history, average uptime, reputation score) for giving services to different types of
projects (any project which requires bandwidth, CPU, RAM, and storage capacity).

2.

Providers and Requesters launch the Stkr software through the user interface of the Stkr platform.

All requesters and providers are registered on Ethereum through the Stkr infrastructure. Privacy of
users will be provided through the pseudo-anonymity of the underlying Ethereum cryptocurrency
addresses.

3.4.2 Creating a node on a provider
When a requester initiates the process for an Ethereum node, the requester should first pay for the
service fee in ANKR tokens and stake at least 32 - k ETH tokens to become a validator where the
provider must stake at least k ETH. The k value is defined by the government and can be updated
later. The k value can also be different for each provider. For requesters who have less than 32 k ETH, the platform will also provide a “micro-pool” system to bring multiple investors to satisfy the
requirements.
1.

Any provider (with a proper resources of capacity) can apply to be approved as a qualified provider
at any time. Notice that each provider is uniquely identified on the Stkr infrastructure.

2.

The Stkr platform encourages any provider to have more than one node by sharing more profits.
Therefore, each provider has a max number of nodes that can be installed based upon their
available capacity.

3.4.3 Assigning as a qualified provider
1.

The government checks the application of potential providers according to the Stkr policy and
approves listing as a qualified provider. For reliability and transparency reasons, the qualified list will be
broadcasted on Ethereum.

2.

When the application is approved, the provider must stake at least Pmin amount of ANKR tokens,
which will be used as the compensation in case of any loss of the requester due to a failure of the
service. All of these processes will also be executed on Ethereum.

In case a provider is qualified for more than one node, the collateral will be the maximal required
amount for the compensation. Any qualified provider P can bid a price BidP to provide a service for
a node. A qualified provider can stake at most Pmax - Pmin number of ANKR tokens as an investment
in the platform where Pmax is the upper bound for the collateral by a qualified provider. All staking
collateral will receive dividend periodically, which comes from the profit generated by all business in the
infrastructure.
3.4.4 Submitting a project proposal by a requester
1.

A requester asks a price for his/her project proposal from the Stkr infrastructure. For example, this
project can be a blockchain full node (e.g., Ethereum 2.0) to be on the Stkr infrastructure using its
underlying functionalities.

2.

The Stkr infrastructure determines how much CPU power, RAM, and storage capacity is required
and then responds with a fixed price FP in terms of fiat currencies as well as the expected profit of
the project.

// Stkr

3.

12

The Stkr infrastructure also provides information about the qualified providers such as capacity,
cost, expected return rate, its performance score and reputation score.

4.

The requester needs to pay FP in terms of cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies to initiate the
evaluation.

5. The Stkr platform initiates an auction process for the project proposal to get the lowest price from
the qualified providers.
6. The requester does not need to provide any staking for the project, but after its completion, the
requester can stake any amount of the profit as an investment.
Any requester, independently from the project, can stake any amount of ANKR tokens. The governance
will record the performance of each provider and give/update their score according to the history of its
performance.
3.4.5 Evaluation of a project by the government
1.

As soon as the requester pays the fixed price, the government will
›

filter out all providers who do not meet the pre-defined requirements of the Stkr infrastructure
in the project.

›

choose those with the lowest bid price.

›

randomly pick up a provider from the resulting list, with probabilities proportional to their scores.
The randomness will be computed in a decentralized manner to be transparent and verifiable.

2.

The Stkr infrastructure assigns the project to the picked provider, who immediately initiates the
project.

3.4.6 The Stkr pools
Insurance Pool: The Stkr infrastructure utilizes an Insurance Pool to reduce the risk of users’ loss
that might be occurred during the staking. For instance, assume that the total 32 ETH deposit of a
node is slashed completely due to an attempt to cheat the ETH 2.0 consensus. In this case, the victim
users on that particular node will be refunded with the entire k ETH from the provider deposit and
the remaining loss of 32 - k ETH will be compensated by the Insurance Pool. Hence, the users
who were on this unfortunate node will not lose their entire deposit as the whole network absorbs
this loss equally. Periodically, the collected rewards in the Insurance Pool will be checked by the Stkr
Governance. When the balance exceeds a pre-defined threshold value, they can be used for other
purposes like transferring to the Reward Pool or burning ANKR tokens.
Reward Pool: The rewards on this pool can be collected as ETH and ANKR. The following policy will be
implemented on the Stkr infrastructure.
›

Each project on the Stkr node has a processing fee to be paid by the requesters and 10% of this fee

›

Once a project is completed, 10% of the total profit will be collected by this pool.

›

Periodically, 30% of this pool will be distributed to governors proportional to their staked amount.

// Stkr

will be collected by the Reward Pool.

13

›

Periodically, 40% of this pool will be distributed to providers and requesters proportional to their
staked amount.

›

20% of this pool will be distributed to ANKR Staking Users (who staked their ANKR tokens on the
sidecar until the project is completed) proportional to their staked amount.

›

The remaining 10% will be used for development and marketing of the Stkr infrastructure.

3.4.7 Computation of profit and distribution
There are basically two conditions to start off a project: 1) A single requester 2) Micro-investors.
In case of a single requester: Suppose a project is demanded by a requester R and the service is
given by a provider P with a bid price BidP which generates a profit X. The distribution of cost and
profit will be as follows:
›

Pprofit = BidP will be kept by the provider P.

›

RPprofit = (X + FP) x 10% will be saved in the Reward Pool.

›

IPprofit = (X + FP) x 10% will be saved in the Insurance Pool.

›

X + FP - Pprofit - RPprofit - IPprofit will be sent back to the requester R.

Here the 10% rate can be adjusted by the governance (on Ethereum for transparency reasons).
In case of micro-investors: In this case, a fixed price FP for processing a node will be publicly
announced. The micro-investors will pay proportional to their stake. For example, if a micro-investor
stakes 4 ETH then he needs to pay 4/32 x FP ANKR tokens. 10% of this fixed price will be
transferred to the Reward Pool. The remaining part will be transferred to the provider (which initiated
this particular node). Once the project is completed, the following policy will be implemented:
›

10% of the total rewards will be sent to the Insurance Pool that will be responsible for the
compensation of any participants’ loss incurred during the staking.

›

10% of the total rewards will be sent to the Reward Pool that will be distributed to the community
members that staked ANKR tokens.

›

80% of the total rewards will be distributed to the requester and the providers who staked ETH.

3.4.8 Profit distribution from the Reward Pool
The Stkr infrastructure periodically distributes collected ANKR tokens from the Reward Pool among the

// Stkr

ANKR stake holders according to their staked amount and period.

14

3.5 A simple example of profit distribution
Assume that a requester asks for a two-months project which requires 4Ghz + 128GB storage + 16GB
RAM. According to the Stkr pricing, it costs ~$50 per month, and therefore, FP = $100 in total. The
requester needs to pay FP to start the process. The Stkr Foundation, on the other hand, will initiate
an auction to fairly determine the qualified provider for this project. Assume that we have only three
qualified providers: P1, P2, P3. Assume also that:
›

P1 submits its bid price of $60,

›

P2 submits its bid price of $70, and

›

P3 submits its bid price of $75.

Note that P1 wins this auction as his bid is the lowest, and therefore will run the project for two months.
Suppose that the collected profit of this project is X = $300 once the project is successfully finished.
Hence, the Stkr platform will automatically (through smart contracts) send:
›

Pprofit = $60 to P1,

›

RPprofit = ($300 + $100) x 10% = $40 to the Reward Pool,

›

IPprofit = ($300 + $100) x 10% = $40 to the Insurance Pool, and

›

$260 = $300 + $100 - $60 - $40 - $40 to the requester.

Once the project is completed, the Reward Pool will also distribute some additional profits to
requesters proportional to their ANKR stake. Hence, the requester pays $100 and receives at least
$260 (i.e., $160 is the profit).

3.6 Penalty conditions
›

If a provider fails to successfully deliver a project, then the provider should immediately pay
the incurred loss to the requester through the governance. The failure will be recorded on the
Ethereum blockchain to provide transparency so that the score of the provider will be affected
accordingly.

›

The collateral will be used to compensate the loss.

›

If there is any stake left, it will be returned to the provider according to the Stkr policy.

›

After starting off a project, the requester can not withdraw it (until it is completed).

›

If the reputation score of a provider is less than a pre-defined threshold then the Stkr infrastructure

// Stkr

will disqualify the provider for a certain period of time.

15

The Stkr government enforces a set of rules that govern both organizational and operational, and is in
charge of any dispute between requesters and providers. The government implements the Stkr policy
such as qualification of providers, rewarding sharing, and task allocations. For non-standard issues, the
government will make decisions through a public and transparent voting mechanism. Each governor will
have an equal weight in voting power irrespective from the amount of stake.

3.7 Conversion of the value generated on PoS for Ethereum 2.0
Until the second phase of Ethereum 2.0 goes live, users will receive an alias-token of ETH (called
aETH) which is equal to the amount of ETH they have deposited. In the second phase, all aliases will be
swapped on the BETH network, and this aliasing will not be used anymore. Users whom deposit ETH to
be staked by the node (hosted on the provider) will instantly receive the aETH token which represents a
tokenized staking deposit. This token:
›

can be held, traded, or sold.

›

does not need to be locked with the Stkr infrastructure to gain staking rewards over time.

›

will be able to be traded for Beacon ETH (BETH) when Phase 2 of the Ethereum 2.0 roll out occurs

// Stkr

and smart contracts on Ethereum 2.0 are enabled.

16

4 	Dynamic scoring for P2P
credit checking
A group of sidecars randomly choose other nodes and remotely audit their functionalities and
availability to prevent any kinds of suspicious operations. Each node will be checked by k number of
sidecars while each sidecar will check k number of other nodes during a fixed period of time. The lists
will be randomly updated for each period to make the Stkr infrastructure more robust and reliable. This

// Stkr

way, the change of the credit over time will be provided.

17

5 	Cost and benefit analysis
of participants
The platform helps requesters to efficiently find the best provider and enables providers to get projects
by utilizing their service. While the platform is organized in a decentralized manner, the Stkr free-market
guarantees efficient trading. In the following sections, we show how all the participants are better off with
this platform.

5.1

For requesters

5.1.1 Benefits
1.

Monetary benefit from getting staking rewards from staking on projects (not necessarily an Stkr
project. For example, it can be Eth 2.0). The benefit is calculated by (project staking reward)
Example: A user staked 3,000 ETH. After 3 days, he gets rewards, including staking and delegation
rewards, about 3 ETH. Meanwhile, he needed to pay the provider 1,500 ANKR tokens. So his overall
benefit is (3 ETH - 1,500 ANKR).

2.

Time saved by running staking nodes instead of setting up an own machine.

5.1.2 Cost
1.

Cost of using the Stkr platform to get a provider to stake tokens.

2.

6 	Future potential projects
on the Stkr infrastructure
The Stkr Infrastructure is not only built for staking purposes, it can also handle computational tasks.
The Stkr infrastructure can expand to other industries in the future, including but not limited to:
›

Blockchain-as-a-service Workloads: The Stkr Infrastructure is not limited to Ethereum 2.0, but
will allow anyone to launch a blockchain in minutes while maintaining privacy, scalability, simple and
fast automatic deployment.

›

Efficient and Secure Deployment of Apps: Security breaches are the most crucial issue for many
operational companies today. They need to make substantial investment to physically secure their
environments by building fences which will never make it safe enough due to control management
issues.

›

IoT or 5G Workloads: With the rapid development of IoT and 5G networks, the traditional central
cloud computing model will evolve into an incentivized and decentralized system. Decentralized
computing provides mobile computation, network control, and storage to network edges to help
reduce latency in critical and computationally intensive applications.

›

Beyond Blockchain (DB/Archive): It can provide the most efficient and cost effective large scale
archive solution which operates without any downsides.

›

High Security IT Workloads: It also prevents adversaries to attack critical infrastructures such as
banking.

›

Decentralized Applications (DApps): Alternative to digital applications such as Facebook, Airbnb,

// Stkr

Twitter, and TikTok.
