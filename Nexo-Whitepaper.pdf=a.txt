Executive Summary
Nexo delivers the World’s First Instant Crypto-backed Loans, thus resolving
a crucial inefficiency for the crypto world. Up to this very moment, no
alternatives existed for digital asset owners to enjoy their crypto wealth
except selling them. The innovative model of Nexo brings to the crypto
community the best of both worlds - retaining 100% ownership of their
digital assets while having immediate access to cash. The Instant Cryptobacked Loans are an automatic, flexible and cost-efficient way of obtaining
liquidity that is secured by the value of the client’s digital assets. The whole
process is completed in just a few simple clicks. No hidden fees, no capital
gains taxes, no credit checks. Transparency is guaranteed through the
use of blockchain technology, smart contracts and algorithmic processes
executed by the Nexo blockchain oracle.

Our Mission
Nexo is committed to successfully solving inefficiencies in
the lending markets by creating innovative, convenient and
sustainable solutions. By harnessing the potential behind
blockchain technology, Nexo is pioneering a new digital financial
system.

Background
The exponential rise of computational power and storage capacities, along with ever-expanding access
to knowledge, are some of the key driving forces of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, as identified by the
latest Global Information Technology Report.1 Blockchain technology is, perhaps, the single most exciting
innovation with enormous implications for revolutionizing products and services, comparable to the
invention of the Internet.
One of the immediate candidates for disruption by this technological advancement is the Financial Services
industry, which, up to very recently, has been unhealthily rigid. Financial technology (FinTech) companies
have challenged the latent incumbents who rely on legacy systems, synonymous with high costs, sluggish
onboarding processes, and inefficient customer service.2 As FinTechs, now powered by blockchain technological
capabilities, continue to pave the new road, it comes as no surprise that 88% of all existing players believe
that they will lose revenue to creative innovators. With $40 billion in capital raised in less than four years,
FinTech companies have gained substantial traction and а solid base of quality-seeking customers (Global
FinТech Report, 2017, PWC). Providing a superior service, ease of use, and lower costs compared to the
service provided by traditional financial institutions is what ensures that FinTech companies will continue
to consolidate their market share at an expedited pace.
Apart from the ubiquitous functions of blockchain technology, such as the point-to-value transfers, there
is one that, up until recently, has been hugely underappreciated – the digitization of assets. The blockchain
immutably records the transfer of tokens or units of ownership on a distributed ledger and thus makes the
process trustless and transparent. The digitization of assets (also known as tokenization) is doing the same
to the securitization of the financial markets as what the advent of the email has done to the post office.
While securitization converts an illiquid asset or group of assets into financial securities, tokenization allows
for that security to be traded over a digital medium with unprecedented ease and cost efficiency.3 Tokens
can either have intrinsic value themselves (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other utility tokens) or be the digital
representation of physical or digital assets (IMF, 2017).
In the USA, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) keeps centralized digital representation
custody of more than $37 trillion worth of shares, and it is not improbable that a substantial amount of these
assets will find their way onto the blockchain via tokenization. Modern investment portfolios consist of
shares, bonds, commodity futures, and other securities, but unlike in previous decades when most of these
instruments had a physical form, rarely are assets physically delivered to their owners today. Ownership

rights are handled through central governing authorities such as the DTCC and others. As the popularity of
decentralized distribution of information and distributed ledger applications pervades the general public,
people will demand tokenization and decentralized recordkeeping and trading processes. Initiatives to
tokenize hard assets into the blockchain are already taking place. In March 2017, Natixis, IBM, and Trafigura
introduced the first blockchain solution for the U.S. crude oil market,4 and it is only a matter of time before
other asset classes are tokenized, tradable, and transferable in a much more efficient manner. Recent
industry research shows that the market capitalization of many tokenized traditional assets, such as equities,
debt, commodities, and real-estate will surpass $4 trillion by 2025.5 The tokenization of real-world assets
is expected to further attract investors by reducing transaction fees, improving transparency with regards
to ownership rights, and ensuring higher liquidity6 and ease of transferability.

The fact that the overall market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has grown from $15 billion in January 2017
to over $527 billion7 in January 2018 makes a strong case for the intrinsic value of this asset class. Although
interest in cryptocurrencies continues to rise, their proliferation into the real economy is yet to come. One
of the main reasons for the limited acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a direct means of payment can be
attributed to the lack of existing technological infrastructure and regulations in most jurisdictions around
the world (IMF, 2017). Extracting the value of cryptocurrencies still requires the owners to convert them to

fiat currencies in exchanges or in p2p transactions. The conversion process entails various exchange fees,
withdrawal fees and capital gain taxes, which ultimately render the entire process slow, time-consuming,
and cost-ineffective.
By setting this introduction to the major technological trends and challenges that accompany any disruption
efforts of the financial industry, this white paper aims to describe in detail the procedure of unlocking the
value of digital assets within the current economic paradigm. Building on the potential of the blockchain,
Nexo will provide the world’s first instant crypto loans.

Problem

Idle Value of Digital Assets
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other emerging cryptocurrencies are rapidly becoming the most widely owned digital
asset class around the globe. The projected total value of those assets is expected to grow to over $5 trillion
by 20258. Throughout the past few years, investors, miners and entrepreneurs have been attracted by the
spectacular rise in the value of cryptocurrencies, which have created significant wealth for these market
participants. Although blockchain technologies have yet to find mainstream adoption, as this inevitably
happens, it will lead to an even higher market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies. However, major
regulatory and infrastructure limitations remain. These entities deter cryptocurrency owners from actually
using them in their day-to-day lives and taking advantage of any immediate investment opportunities that
require liquid cash or meet any short-term obligations (IMF, 2017). Thus, it is not surprising that an analysis
performed on cryptocurrency wallets shows that the majority of the transactions are inward with only a
fraction of the wallets having outgoing transactions at all.

Solution

Unlock the Value of Digital Assets
Instead of simply holding idle digital assets, investors, miners and entrepreneurs have the opportunity to
set up an instant crypto loan with Nexo, combining the best of both worlds -- hodl-ing their crypto assets
and having access to instant cash. By transferring crypto assets to their Nexo аccounts, Nexo’s clients are
able to instantly access cash that is denominated in fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, and JPY. The Cryptobacked Loan is secured by the market value of the digital asset placed in the аccount.

Problem

Slow Liquidation Process
Liquidating a digital asset can be burdensome in many ways. Different crypto exchanges trade different
digital assets and have different requirements, procedures, and withdrawal limitations, which can slow down
the liquidation process and be costly. Moreover, the clearing bank, which turns the digital asset into a fiat
currency, has its own procedures and fees that it transfers to the customer, adding costs and slowing down
the whole process even further. The overall time it might take to complete the transaction could be from
several days to a month, which is inconvenient in situations where the seller has an urgent need for cash.

Solution

Quick Access to Cash
Nexo’s clients are able to receive cash instantly anywhere around the globe, seize investment opportunities,
and meet liquidity needs immediately. While withdrawing large amounts of cash is more conveniently done via
bank transfers, Nexo’s retail clients have the option to use the free Nexo card for their day-to-day expenses.

11

Problem

Loss of Ownership
In order to benefit from the intrinsic value of their digital asset, the owners only have the limited option
of selling them for fiat currencies. This means losing ownership of the asset and forgoing any future price
appreciation potential it might have. For example, a company that has conducted an ICO would miss
out on the entire price appreciation of a cryptocurrency that it collected from the crowdfunding but sold
subsequently to meet capital, R&D, and operating expenditures.

Solution

Retain Ownership
Clients retain 100% ownership of their digital assets. By making use of Nexo’s instant crypto loan rather
than selling, they keep the entire capital gains and accompanying benefits from their digital assets. Nexo’s
clients can enjoy their crypto wealth immediately, without having to sell their digital assets.

Problem

Expensive & Tax Inefficient
Depending on the exchange which is used, fees are applied to transactions, including platform fees, usually
large bid-ask spreads, and withdrawal and transaction fees. Most crucially, selling a digital asset triggers tax
liabilities. The latest “Worldwide Personal Tax and Immigration Guide”9 published by Ernst & Young shows
that capital gains taxes range widely from 15% to up to 39% depending on the country and income bracket
of the person facing the tax liability. Therefore, selling it results in a substantial decrease of the realized
profit. This renders the entire approach of selling a digital asset to meet a short-term need for liquidity an
expensive and tax-inefficient solution. Overall, the process of selling leaves the crypto owner in search of
a better alternative to unlock the value of his or her digital assets.

Solution

Cost and Tax Efficient
Without having to sell their digital assets on exchanges, the owners do not have to pay any platform,
transaction, or withdrawal fees that could carve substantial amounts out of their profits. Furthermore,
since there is no sale event, there are no taxes that could decrease gains by up to 39%, depending on the
seller’s ordinary residency.

Problem

Cumbersome Credit Checks
The worldwide value of the consumer lending market is estimated to reach $48.3 trillion by 2019,10 and
it is one of the main economic drivers worldwide, as it provides the general public with additional access
to finance. Consumer lending is directly linked to the consumer spending, which is the backbone of every
advanced economy. Most credit institutions perform what are referred to as “hard” credit checks each time
a person applies for a loan. The goal of those credit checks is to minimize and mitigate the risks of defaults
and to set an appropriate interest rate in accordance with the risk profile associated with the borrower.
However, the hard credit check procedure is known to leave a mark on the credit score of the applicant.
Recent research11 performed in 2017 by TSB Bank concluded that the damage left from “hard” credit
checks is substantial and leads to a significant devaluation of the applicant’s credit score. Hard checks lead
to increased interest rates, depending on the number of applications for unsecured lending instruments.
In conclusion, accessing unsecured financing requires lengthy credit checks and often results in lower
personal credit scores and higher interest rates on the customer’s loans.

Solution

No Credit Checks
Nexo does not perform any credit checks that could damage the credit rating of its clients, as the crypto
loan is completely secured by the value of the digital assets stored in the Nexo Account.

Problem

Lack of Trust and Transparency
Up to now, transactions aiming to procure loans and financing secured by crypto assets were primarily settled
through P2P platforms and bilateral agreements. These options usually lack adequate security standards
and transparency, which is something one would not expect from services associated with blockchain
technology. A simple search through forums such as Bitcointalk, regarding P2P lending, reveals a world filled
with fraud, interest rates closer to usury than market conditions, etc. The legal status of such arrangements
are of a dubious nature and could possibly never be enforced by courts of justice.

Solution

Transparent Blockchain Contracts
Ownership of digital assets is secured and guaranteed by transparent loan contracts, which will ultimately
be stored on the Blockchain where it is technologically possible.

14

Business Model
The business model of Nexo is to provide instant crypto loans in order to unlock the value of the digital assets
owned by its clients. The process is simple and can be broken down into a few simple steps:

Step 1: The Client transfers Crypto Assets to the Nexo Account
A prospective client transfers crypto assets to their Nexo Account. Once the relevant blockchain confirmations
for the respective crypto asset are received, the Nexo blockchain oracle automatically calculates the Loan
limits and instantly sets up the loan.

Step 2: The Client Receives Instant Loan in USD or EURO
The Loan limit is instantly available by bank transfer or the free Nexo Card. Depending on their needs and
circumstances, the clients can choose the most convenient way to use their cash, as well as the currencies
in which they would like to receive the funds. The loan limit is based on the market value of the crypto
assets in the Nexo Account. Should the cryptocurrency appreciate in value, the Nexo blockchain oracle
increases the loan limit.

15

Step 3: The Client Repays Loan
Clients can repay their flexible loans in multiple ways – via bank transfer, fiat or cryptocurrency. Special
discounts on the interest rates are granted to those choosing to make payments with NEXO tokens. A
third option is to pay by partial sale of the crypto assets (BTC, ETH, etc.) in their Nexo Account. In addition
to the flexible repayment options, Nexo does not require any monthly minimum repayments as long as
the outstanding balance is within the available loan limit. Once a repayment is received, Nexo blockchain
oracle records the transaction on the blockchain and instantly updates the loan limits.

Step 4: Withdraw Crypto from Nexo Account
If the crypto assets in the аccount meet the required limits of the outstanding loan balance, clients can
withdraw part or all exceeding amount at any given time. Once the loan is fully repaid, clients can withdraw
all of the crypto assets in the аccount.

Our Clients
Cryptocurrency Investors
Bitcoin and the rising number of other cryptocurrencies have attracted millions of
investors throughout 2017. As previously mentioned, the overall cryptocurrency market
capitalization has risen to a staggering $527 billion in January 2018, thus creating a
sizeable amount of wealth for early investors and entrepreneurs.
There are innumerable reasons why people need liquid cash on hand such as pressing
unexpected expenses or attractive limited-time offers. Cryptocurrency investors, who
want to enjoy the fruits of their investments today without having to sell their digital
assets, can benefit from Nexo’s unique proposition and make use of the free Nexo Card
to pay for day-to-day expenses or meet other needs.

Hedge Funds
At the present date, there are over 175 hedge funds focusing exclusively on cryptocurrency
investments13 with about $4 billion in total assets under management.
All funds that already have invested capital under management in crypto assets are also
direct beneficiaries of Nexo’s Instant Crypto-backed Loans. By placing their digital assets
in an Nexo Account, these hedge funds are able to gain leverage as they gain access to
additional capital by giving them greater flexibility to structure their portfolios.

Crypto Miners
Cryptocurrency miners are one of the most integral parts of the blockchain
technology and are directly responsible for the grouping of all unconfirmed transactions
into blocks and for their recording on the distributed ledger. Therefore, miners are often
referred to as the backbone of the decentralized world. For performing this activity,
miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency, which most of them like to hold. The recent

13. Crypto Fund List Segmentation

21

Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study published by the University of Cambridge
(Hileman and Rauchs, 2017) identified that Bitcoin miners earned billions of dollars in
the past several years due to the appreciating value of cryptocurrencies; one can see
why they are not too eager to depart from their crypto holding. Having started just as a
hobby performed by single PC enthusiasts, mining nowadays requires vast amounts of
computing power, state-of-the-art equipment, and huge electricity capacities. Meeting
those increasingly competitive requirements pressures miners, who are looking to
expand their operations to liquidate their digital asset rewards and potentially miss out
on future gains from those assets’ appreciation. Nexo offers miners a flexible instant
crypto loan, which will enable them to fund their increasing capital expenditures and
operating expenses without having to sell their assets.

Crypto Companies
Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are steadily becoming an ever more popular way to raise
capital. Coin Desk’s ICO Tracker reports14 that companies that have conducted ICOs raised
over $3.7 billion from February 2014 to January 2018. During the typical ICO, companies
generally accept cryptocurrencies. Once the offerings are completed, companies sell part
or all of their proceeds for fiat currencies in order to fund their operations or meet their
capital expenses. Instead of selling their cryptocurrency proceeds and losing substantial
potential crypto, companies can also use an instant loan from Nexo to finance their needs.

Cryptocurrency Exchanges
Exchanges are another essential part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, matching buyers
and sellers of the digital assets. Тhe rising number of cryptocurrency exchanges intensifies
the rivalry among them and the struggle to keep and attract customers. Nexo instant
crypto loan is specifically designed to provide partnering digital asset exchanges with
additional leverage and liquidity in order to support their margin lending activities and
enable them to reach higher capital efficiencies.

Owners of Tokenized Assets
As mentioned earlier, by 2025 the overall market of the tokenized assets is projected to
exceed 5 trillion. This will allow investors to easily acquire a wide range of asset classes
that have diverse risk profiles and characteristics, such as:

Precious Metals Investors
Gold has been a safe haven for over two millennia, and it is one of the first hard assets
to get tokenized. Most notably, the Royal Mint and CME Group have introduced
RMG - a new, cost-effective, convenient, and secure way to hold, transact, and trade
physical gold using blockchain technology. Other companies like Digix Global provide
a user-friendly way for investors to get fast exposure to gold through tokens, which are
reportedly 100% backed by the precious metal. This presents an excellent opportunity
for investors to transfer them in their Nexo Account and receive an instant loan against
their tokenized gold holdings.

ETFs and ETNs Investors
In recent years exchange traded funds (ETFs) and exchange traded notes (ETNs) continue
to gain popularity among investors as they are cheaper passive investment alternatives to
traditionally active managed funds and deliver comparable if not better returns. The global
ETF market just recently surpassed $4 trillion and is expected to continue its growth15.
Some of the companies developing solutions to tokenize various assets and securities
include BrickBlock, LA Token, Blackmoon Crypto, and Bankex. These companies deploy
proof-of-asset protocols that ensure off-chain asset ownership.
The opportunity to tokenize securities traded on legacy exchanges is immense, and
Nexo believes that very soon it will be possible for crypto investors to access those
security-backed tokens and diversify their portfolio. Nexo is partnering up with all major
security-backed token issuers in order to provide its clients with access to instant loans
secured by liquid tokenized assets.

Loyalty-Reward Token Owners
Loyalty-reward programs are widely used across many domains including retail, hospitality,
travel, and financial services. According to research conducted by Colloquy, the average
U.S. household participates in 29 loyalty programs16. The overall value of the loyalty
rewards industry is estimated to be around $60 billion17. Researchers claim that the
loyalty rewards industry is going to face major disruption by companies that utilize
blockchain technology18. Those innovative companies will provide the convenient
redemption of loyalty points on a single platform (Kowalewski, McLaughlin, and Hill,
2017). Incent is developing a loyalty reward token that aims to disrupt the industry. As
part of its roadmap, Nexo plans to accept loyalty reward tokens and allow their owners
to access instant cash through the crypto loan.

Video Gamers and Virtual Reality Users
The 2017 Global Games Market Report19 shows that there are currently over 2.2 billion
gamers around the globe who generate $108.9 billion in revenue. Research suggests
that by 2020, the gaming industry will reach over $128.5 billion. According to recent
market research data, the virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) industry is
going to reach $122 billion by 2021. In total, the video game and VR/AR industries will
have a cumulative value of over $250 billion by 2021. A significant part of the revenues
generated by the companies operating in the video game and VR/AR industries comes
from virtual items bought by their users. The leading marketplace for in-game items
OPSkins, estimates that there are currently over 400 million gamers who trade virtual
assets worth more than $50 billion.
The Worldwide Asset Exchange (WAX) is the biggest player that has already developed
blockchain solutions to tokenize in-game items. Nexo will accept WAX tokens in order
to provide instant crypto loans to gamers who want to retain ownership of their perished
video-game items.

Competitive Landscape
The competitive analysis shows how Nexo’s Instant Crypto-backed Loans compare with alternative
products and services.

Nexo vs. Traditional Lending

Nexo’s Instant Crypto-backed Loan allows clients to retain 100% ownership of their crypto assets and to
profit from their potential upside. Furthermore, Nexo’s product is accessible with no credit checks and does
not have geographic restrictions. The crypto loan is extended instantly as there is no approval procedure.
As soon as the crypto assets are transferred to the Nexo Account and the transaction is confirmed on the
blockchain, the client can start spending the fiat currency of their choice. The interest rates are highly
competitive and there are no additional or hidden fees.

25

Nexo vs. Other Lending Platforms

A number of companies promise lending solutions to the crypto community, and currently all of them are
operating as P2P platforms for collateralized and uncollateralized loans. The decentralization of lending
brings significant costs and slows down the whole process, ultimately resulting in a deteriorating user
experience. Lenders who are willing to participate in those platforms carry the significant burden of managing,
monitoring, and supervising loan offers, which makes it inconvenient and inefficient. Matching borrowers
with lenders who are willing to fund the loan requests takes a lot of time, as terms must be agreed upon by
all of the parties involved. These characteristics of P2P lending render the whole process cumbersome and
slow. Recent data shows clearly that the demand for loans is much greater than the supply, resulting in an

26

inefficient market. Nexo is there to bridge precisely this gap, ensuring enough supply of funds to provide
instant loans, thus providing adequate liquidity for the crypto community in an efficient manner.
Furthermore, getting funding from Nexo is a seamless, instant process. Whereas other providers charge
membership, application, and/or funding fees on top of their interest rates, Nexo has no fees whatsoever and a
very competitive annual interest rate. Furthermore, NEXO token holders enjoy discounted repayment
rates while loan limits can be increased using NEXO tokens, just as they can with Bitcoin or Ethereum.
Nexo’s business model is designed with the sole mission of aligning clients’ interests with those of the
company.

Nexo vs. Alternative Financing Options

including details on financial and non-financial parameters, has been extracted from publicly available
information and all calculations represent our best estimate of cost for exploiting such services

27

Assumptions:
Let us assume that the client has in his possession Bitcoins and requires fiat money in order to fulfill a financial
need, whatever that might be. In particular, let’s assume that he has the following portfolio:
Ownership of 5 BTC purchased at $2,100
Needed financing = $14,000
Current price of BTC = $4,000 (Net Worth = $20,000)
Days fiat is needed = 60 days
The client seeks short-term financing equal to $14,000 for 60 days and desires to retain ownership of Bitcoin
(BTC) after the completion of the transaction (5 BTC) while minimizing costs.21

Financing options:
1. Nexo Instant Crypto-backed Loan
The client sets up an instant crypto loan for $14,000 without any credit checks. He transfers 5
BTC to his Nexo Account and gets cash instantly via bank wire or credit card. With this strategy,
the client pays only interest with no trade or deposit fees and does not become liable to capital
gains tax because no sale of assets occurs.

2. Sell & Buy Option
The client sells 70% of his holdings today for $14,000 and repurchases the same amount of Bitcoins
in 60 days at the future price. Once a position is liquidated, the client pays trade, exchange and
withdrawal fees, and he is liable for capital gains tax. When he has to re-establish his position by
repurchasing the coins in 60 days, the client once again faces trade, exchange and deposit fees.
Obviously, a lot can happen in two months, and the sale price might substantially differ from
the new purchase price; thus, the client is exposed to the volatility of the market on top of the
additional cost, which he pays.

3. Sell & Margin Lending Option
The client sells 70% of Bitcoins today for $14,000 with all applicable fees and taxes. The remaining
30% of Bitcoins are used to open a 3.33x margin trading position in order to mimic the ownership

21. Net Worth is defined as the total change in net value, including fees paid, taxes
due and net gains/losses from change in BTC price in 60 days. The client is rational
and seeks to explore options with different risk appetite and volatility.

28

of 5 BTC. The client becomes liable for additional exchange fees, opening/closing margin trading
position fees, and rollover interest for maintaining an open margin trading position for 60 days. In
two months, the client closes the margin and repurchases the BTC at the future price, becoming
exposed to market volatility and counterparty risk. By applying this strategy, the client is able to
retain the upside potential from a Bitcoin price increase but at a high cost.

4. Futures & Swaps
The client sells 70% of Bitcoins today for $14,000 with all applicable fees/taxes. The remaining
30% of Bitcoins are used to open a short/long swap or future position. In order to mimic ownership
of 5 BTC, a 3.33x margin is utilized. By using swaps, the client pays additional exchange fees and
interest expenses for maintaining an open swap/future position for 60 days. This trading strategy
is highly speculative and risky – it requires specific knowledge of financial instruments and trading
techniques.

Summary of Net Worth under BTC price change

In case of a constant bitcoin price, the Nexo instant crypto loan delivers a 7-times cheaper solution when
compared to the sell & buy option as described above. The cost has been calculated based on the price
structures of several of the major cryptocurrency exchanges. The sell & buy back option includes fees like
platform usage, bid-ask spread, withdrawal, transaction (miners) fees, and capital gains on crypto asset
sales while Nexo includes only interest. Moreover, when the price of bitcoin increases, while the client uses
his Nexo instant crypto loan, he benefits as he ultimately owns it (a 20% increase in bitcoin price leads to an
additional $4,000 gain for the client).
The sell & margin lending approach is 7.8 times more expensive than an Instant crypto loan form Nexo.
And with margin selling, the client also retains the price appreciation opportunities but exposes himself
to the following:

29

·

Market Volatility – margin trading involves substantial risks of total loss and requires special technical
knowledge if it is to be executed properly.

·

Margin Calls – on the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, for example, an investor would receive a margin
call at 80% of the funds pledged in his margin account, and his position will be liquidated at 40%. In
the current example, if the client pledges $6,000 of own funds to open a 3.33x margin position at
$20,000, he would receive a margin call as soon as the price of Bitcoin decreased by 6%, and he would
be liquidated when the price of Bitcoin dropped by 18%. Percentage changes in cryptocurrency trading
occur on a regular basis; thus, the risk of early liquidation and undesired fees and costs is not negligible.

Trading swaps and futures is more than 10 times more expensive than taking advantage of an instant crypto
loan from Nexo. In addition, derivatives trading are a complex endeavour that requires experience and
serious funding and might result in losses that exceed the initial deposit. Furthermore, derivatives trading
require access to platforms that require highly technical trading knowledge, which makes the process too
complex for retail investors. In a swap/forward scenario within the current example, the liquidation would
begin as soon as the price of Bitcoin decreased by 15%.
The cost efficiency of the Nexo instant crypto loans, the flexibility of available funds whenever the customer
needs them, and the retained ownership of the digital asset all make Nexo a much better choice to instantly
unlock the value of digital assets.

Technology
Nexo blockchain oracle
The critical, essential part of our technological model is Nexo blockchain oracle – an automated system that
maintains the elements of the business processes and has the functionalities as identified in the diagram
below:

Development of loan contracts:
When a crypto loan is set up, the Nexo blockchain oracle is responsible for the automatic disbursement of
cash, asset maintenance, notifications, and overall management.

Development of real-time data aggregation:
The Nexo blockchain oracle performs real-time asset valuation based on data from multiple exchanges
at any given point in time. The Nexo blockchain oracle maintains live data aggregation from at least 6
independent sources (exchanges), which minimizes overall risk for both Nexo and the client. The Nexo

31

blockchain oracle also detects live changes in asset value and recalculates loan limits. In the case of asset
price appreciation, the loan limit is automatically and instantly increased.

Development of repayment analytics module:
The Nexo blockchain oracle automatically records repayments and further accounts for all transactions
made by clients. Interest repayments, outstanding balances, and up-to-date loan limits are automatically
maintained at all times by the system.

Development of automated notifications:
All loan maintenance actions are automatically executed by the Nexo blockchain oracle without any manual
intervention – change in asset value and loan limit; cash inflows/outflows; maintenance and rebalancing
warnings are issued in case of reached minimum crypto asset limits; individual account balances are updated
with repayments; administrative notifications are sent to the client with all relevant information.

Development of modeling and algorithms:
In order to secure the proper functioning of the system, Nexo integrates big data analyses, self-regulating
algorithms, and prediction modelling in the Nexo blockchain oracle. That way, Nexo can guarantee that the
information received from multiple external data sources is used for proper on-time business decision-making.

32

Loan Contracts

Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are pre-written computer protocols that aim to facilitate a trustless and secure relationship
between two parties. Their key features include immutability and traceability, which create transparency
and remove the need for third-party involvement24. Although not all blockchains currently support smart
contracts, Nexo’s long-term goal is to enable a fully automated trustless system across all blockchain assets
supported by the Nexo Account. This can be achieved through strategic partnerships with companies that
are currently developing cross-chain solutions such as Polkadot.
The smart contract used by Nexo will record the current outstanding balances of the client’s Nexo Account.
Interest will be accrued on the utilized loan balances. Once clients repay their loans or use more of their
available limits, Nexo will either credit or debit the balance and record the updated one on the blockchain.
Once they are fully functioning across different blockchains, the smart contracts will be the primary
mechanism that regulates most functions of the Nexo Instant Crypto-backed Loans. Until the complete
and stable development of cross-chain technologies allow the deployment of smart contracts, most of
those functionalities will be delivered through the Nexo blockchain oracle.

33

Risk Management
In order to minimize any risks, the Nexo blockchain oracle tracks the changes of the crypto assets’ value
placed in the Nexo Account in real time. To avoid any price discrepancies, the Nexo blockchain oracle will
draw real-time data from several different sources. The crypto assets within the client’s Nexo Account should
have value to cover the outstanding loan at all times. If the price of the crypto assets placed in the аccount
increase, the Nexo blockchain oracle will immediately increase the amount of cash available to the client.
Should the value of the crypto assets decrease below a liquidation ratio (dependant on the assets within the
аccount), the Nexo blockchain oracle acts accordingly and mitigates the risk of reaching the minimum loan
requirements by a smooth repayment of the loan. There are various scenarios, which could occur throughout
the loan usage that require Nexo blockchain oracle’s interference. For the purpose of illustration, examples
of Nexo’s expected situation handling actions are shown below.
Once the client has set up their account with Nexo, they agree to the terms and conditions, and they will transfer
crypto assets to their Nexo Account. The Nexo blockchain oracle automatically updates the funds, which
are instantly available to the client through his Nexo card.
A few days later, the Nexo blockchain oracle detects that the value of the crypto assets placed in the Nexo
Account by the client have decreased below the minimum required limits, which leads to an immediate
recalculation of the available loan limit. The Nexo blockchain oracle issues instant notifications to the client
through multiple channels, including the client’s Nexo Account and via SMS and e-mail. In case the client
has a larger outstanding balance than the available limit, the Nexo blockchain oracle provides the client
with the following options:

34

35

Option I: Add More Crypto Assets to the
Nexo Account
Clients can transfer additional crypto assets to their аccount in order to rebalance the loan limits. In this
specific case, the Nexo blockchain oracle automatically calculates the additional crypto assets that the
clients would have to add to their аccount, and once the transfer is confirmed, his loan limits are instantly
updated. Whenever clients repay the loan or have any excess crypto placed in their аccount, they can
securely withdraw it.

Option II: Partial Repayment
Clients also have the option to repay the difference between the loan limit and current loan outstanding
amount. In this case, the Nexo blockchain oracle calculates the amount needed to be covered and the
client pays it by wire or by transferring crypto. Although the Nexo blockchain oracle will take all necessary
actions to inform the client in a timely manner regarding any changes in the value of his crypto assets, it
should be considered that it might not act upon the issued notifications. In this case, the Nexo blockchain
oracle will automatically cover the difference between the loan limit and current loan outstanding amount
by proceeding to a rebalancing maintenance.

Rebalancing Maintenance
In cases where the client does not act on the notifications issued by the Nexo blockchain oracle and does
not opt to transfer additional crypto assets or repay the required amount, the Nexo blockchain oracle
executes a rebalancing maintenance. The price of the pledged crypto assets is verified at multiple exchanges
so that the best possible terms are secured. In this specific case, the Nexo blockchain oracle uses the best
possible price on the market and sells crypto assets to rebalance loan limits. All relevant taxes related to
the transaction will be covered through the client’s loan.

36

Customer Acquisition
The new paradigm of global interconnectedness requires new marketing strategies, which will attract
and retain loyal customers from around the world. Nurturing a strong community and mutually beneficial
strategic partnerships are two of the main objectives that will support Nexo’s growth and success.

Airdrop Campaigns
In order to expand and nurture the Nexo community, we will execute multiple Airdrop campaigns. The
participants in the Nexo Airdrop campaigns will be able to receive free NEXO tokens that will allow them
to benefit from lower interest rates and/or higher limits on their instant crypto loans. To participate in
Nexo Airdrop campaigns, people will be required to fulfil predefined conditions that will be described and
distributed via multiple communication channels. Upon successful campaign completion and meeting
the predefined requirements, the participants will receive their free Nexo tokens in their Nexo Аccount,
which they can use immediately towards their instant crypto loans - thus being exposed to Nexo’s product
at minimal marketing cost-per-acquisition.

Referral & Affiliate Programs
Nexo’s clients and supporters can participate in special referral programs that reward their efforts to attract
new clients and expand the Nexo community. The program ensures that supporters who refer new clients
to Nexo will receive preferential interest rates on their instant crypto loans.

Strategic Partnerships
Operating in the constantly evolving cryptocurrency/blockchain ecosystem requires engagement in
strategic partnerships that support the overall development of the community and Nexo’s business model.
For example, we can use wallet integrations by implementing a button that allows users of widely used wallet
apps to set up a crypto loan instantly with Nexo. This is currently being discussed with several wallet providers.
