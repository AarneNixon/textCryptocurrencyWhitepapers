Introduction
Online content consumption across many, if not most, web sites doesn’t align well with
advertising practices. There is a deepening conflict between a good online User Experience
that readers want and survival necessity for publishers who want to serve as much
advertising​ ​as​ ​possible​ ​to​ ​make​ ​their​ ​business​ ​model​ ​work.
Like many other traditional industries, the media business is struggling and going through a
major transformation powered by new technologies, implemented via new user experiences
and supported by proper business models to drive such change toward a real and
sustainable solution and not a solution that goes on to create another set of problems (as
has​ ​happened​ ​with​ ​“native”​ ​and​ ​“programmatic”​ ​advertising​ ​approaches).
Among many challenges, the media industry and overall the online publishing, advertising,
and​ ​internet​ ​services​ ​sectors​ ​are​ ​facing​ ​the​ ​following​ ​issues:
● Retention of readers who increasingly are switching to social media as their primary
source​ ​of​ ​news​ ​and​ ​other​ ​daily​ ​information​ ​of​ ​interest;
● Fast​ ​growth​ ​of​ ​ad​ ​blockers​,​ ​especially​ ​among​ ​Millennials​ ​and​ ​other

technology-advanced​ ​readers​ ​in​ ​general​ ​that​ ​are​ ​not​ ​hesitant​ ​to​ ​install​ ​such​ ​browser
plugins​ ​on​ ​their​ ​desktop​ ​and​ ​now​ ​mobile​ ​computing​ ​platform;

● Extensive ​fraud problems of monetization within the AdTech industry, usually

attributed to bot traffic (sometimes called “arbitrage traffic”) that many publishers buy
knowingly or not; this problem is increasingly causing brands and advertisers to
redirect their budgets away from sites running just classical display ad campaigns,
which​ ​in​ ​turn​ ​causes​ ​major​ ​financial​ ​setback​ ​for​ ​those​ ​relying​ ​on​ ​this​ ​business​ ​model;

●

Questionable practices such as ​Pay-to-play (or Guaranteed CPM approach) that are

causing asymmetrical relationships with providers of technology and causing
short-term​ ​wins​ ​but​ ​long​ ​term​ ​losses​ ​for​ ​publishers​ ​who​ ​entertain​ ​them;

6

On top of this comes the most ​fundamental problem of online publishing​: an eternal conflict

between, on one hand, the need to create and maintain good content encapsulated within a
good user experience (UX), and on the other hand the need to make money via advertising
(especially programmatic) which is very hard, almost impossible, to balance and sites usually
do​ ​well​ ​either​ ​one​ ​or​ ​the​ ​other,​ ​but​ ​rarely​ ​both​ ​simultaneously.
People who use ad blockers are now dealing with soft or hard warnings that content will be
available ONLY if they turn off their blockers, which creates a “no win” situation between
publishers​ ​and​ ​their​ ​audiences.
With the introduction of Blockchain into the Media industry, including the first wave of pilot
implementations of various cryptocurrencies for attention, advertising, engagement etc., is
certainly a step in the right direction and serves the ultimate goal of establishing a new type
of relationship, where all three parts of the “Industry Triangle” (​Readers -- ​Publishers ​--

Advertisers​) are motivated and have proper incentives, enabling a true Win-Win-Win
environment.
1World is a firm believer in motivating readers of the web sites to come visit more often via
giving them incentives for their engagements and contributions, and offering a choice of
being exposed or not to the ads on the site. All these elements have to come together to
make​ ​the​ ​“Reader​ ​–​ ​Publisher​ ​--​ ​Advertiser”​ ​triangle​ ​work.
The 1World platform has been providing the tools and the network for deployments since
2013, and the next step is further decentralizing it and introducing 1World (1WO) Tokens that
will be circulating in this triangle and bringing benefits to all parties involved: namely,
readers earn for engagement, publishers get new revenue streams, and advertisers receive
discounts​ ​and​ ​access​ ​to​ ​wide-spread​ ​diversified​ ​and​ ​attractive​ ​inventory.
The future in this industry is decentralized models where the economy of interactions is built
on very natural principles where people are legitimate active PARTICIPANTS with rights of
their own rather than just being treated as cookie-tagged “subjects of advertising” in
respective “digital prisons”​*1 driven by a few monopolistic players. This future eliminates
both monopolism of these behemoths and turns the digital economy back over to people

7

with proper experiences, ownership of their online identity, and incentives that bring more
value​ ​to​ ​them.

The​ ​experience​ ​no​ ​reader​ ​really​ ​wants!

8

1World​ ​Vision​ ​&​ ​Execution
1World Online is a Silicon Valley company headquartered and operating in San Jose,
California since 2012 with a mission to build a global software platform to supplement online
content with interactive tools (such as Polls, Surveys, Quizzes, Insights pages, Interactive
Maps and other formats) that help answer the question ​“What Do People Really Think?” This

is done via contextual, relevant, organic, and highly engaging data collection with analytical
insighst​ ​on​ ​site​ ​and​ ​across​ ​network​ ​of​ ​participating​ ​sites.
We believe that any business objective in online services centered around content
publishing should be accomplished via organic experiences where a conversation with
readers has to be established first (e.g., via presenting a poll widget related to the article that
the reader will be motivated to vote on and express their opinion), then the publisher learns
more about this user (not only the immediate response, but also a history of previous
responses to various questions and other engagements observed and captured by the
1World tools), so this analysis helps to provide better content (e.g., next question in the
rotation or suggested articles to read next) and better promotion, such as a targeted
advertisement​ ​or​ ​commercial​ ​mini-survey​ ​or​ ​some​ ​other​ ​type​ ​of​ ​online​ ​service​ ​offering.
This​ ​approach​ ​can​ ​be​ ​stated​ ​in
three​ ​value-proposition​ ​words:
“​Engage​ ​--​ ​Research​ ​–
Promote​”,​ ​which​ ​is​ ​a

progression​ ​model​ ​where​ ​all

participating​ ​parties​ ​(Readers,
Publishers​ ​and​ ​Advertisers)
benefit​ ​simultaneously.

Here is an example of typical 1World Deployment (in this case: ​San Francisco Examiner​) where
the article is supplemented with a 1World widget automatically showing relevant poll

questions to supplement the content and initiate a conversation between the reader and the

9

publisher plus an advertising component that also is contextual and better targeted for the
specific​ ​reader​ ​based​ ​on​ ​context,​ ​history​ ​of​ ​engagements,​ ​and​ ​responses​ ​to​ ​poll​ ​questions.

10

History​ ​of​ ​1World​ ​Development​ ​and​ ​Deployments
Since its start in 2012, 1World has built and delivered a robust and comprehensive interactive
platform that includes front-end ​tools, a ​back-end ​dashboard of analytics, and a ​network ​of
participating publishers around the world. In addition, various organizations and brands are
using​ ​1World​ ​tools​ ​for​ ​interactive​ ​campaigns​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as​ ​ongoing​ ​audience​ ​engagements.
The front-end includes a variety of interactive, easy-to-customize tools such as Polls,
Quizzes, Debates, Trivia Feeds, Surveys, and Interactive Maps.

Each of them helps

publishers and brands learn from and engage with their particular audiences to maximize
engagement​ ​and​ ​increase​ ​revenue​ ​and​ ​efficiency​ ​of​ ​campaigns.

1World automatically produces ​Smart Content ​(such as Insights pages that include

interactive maps and other analytics) that are linked to the modules (widgets) installed on
partner sites. This content increases sharing over social networks, improves relevancy, and
draws​ ​in​ ​new​ ​readers—with​ ​the​ ​core​ ​benefits​ ​of​ ​increasing​ ​audience​ ​and​ ​reach.

11

​​​​

1World ​Analytics ​includes a suite of data analysis, research tools, and capabilities that

provide insight into consumer opinions, preferences, and behaviors. 1World is also an IBM
Watson Certified Partner and provides cognitive science powered analytics incorporating
Watson.

1World contracted partners are Google, AOL, Sekindo, Matomy for Advertisement; CINT for
Data (profiling and paid survey participation for users), IBM Watson for analytics and more
targeted​ ​advertising​ ​and​ ​content​ ​recommendations.

12

1World​ ​Today
1World​ ​has​ ​well-developed​ ​products,​ ​business​ ​models,​ ​and​ ​deployments:

Market​ ​size​ ​and​ ​opportunity
According to DENTSU Aegis​[​2​] Global ad spend will reach $563.4 billion in 2017 with digital
driving​ ​growth​ ​at​ ​3.8%​ ​amid​ ​cautious​ ​near-term​ ​outlook.
“We are reaching a tipping point in ad spend now as digital overtakes television,
mobile overtakes desktop and paid search overtakes print. Digital and data must now
be the default settings for advertisers. Evolving to people-based marketing rather than
audience-based marketing and using data to increase addressability is essential for
brands to manage tighter conditions in 2017 while positioning themselves for future
growth.”
--​ ​Jerry​ ​Buhlmann,​ ​CEO​ ​of​ ​Dentsu​ ​Aegis​ ​Network

Combined with the overall size of online services this creates an enormous opportunity to
address one of the biggest Internet behaviors, as a product, on an unprecedented scale.

14

1World​ ​Intellectual​ ​Property​ ​(IP)​ ​Portfolio
1World has an IP patent portfolio it has been developing since 2012 in collaboration with top
law firm Wilmer Hale, utilizing both their Silicon Valley and Boston offices. 1World files its
patents first in the USA, and then usually pursues International filings, PCT applications to
cover Europe and also files in select Asian countries such as Japan and China. The first five
patents filed by 1World covered the basic 1World service and widget-analytics system and its
applications for engagement, research, and content syndication and includes the following
patent​ ​filings:
● Chains​ ​of​ ​Polls​ ​as​ ​a​ ​unique​ ​data​ ​collection​ ​engine
U.S.​ ​Patent​ ​Application​ ​No.:​ ​ ​61/841,022

● Dynamic​ ​Analytics​ ​Research​ ​Engine​ ​/​ ​Normalization​ ​algorithm
U.S.​ ​Patent​ ​Application​ ​No.:​ ​ ​61/841,118

● Interactive​ ​Data​ ​Exchange​ ​Network

U.S.​ ​Patent​ ​Application​ ​No.:​ ​ ​ ​62/046,554

● Crowdsourced​ ​Polls​ ​and​ ​their​ ​sharing​ ​in​ ​public​ ​space
U.S.​ ​Patent​ ​Application​ ​No.:​ ​ ​ ​2209340.00125US1

● Insight​ ​Pages​ ​&​ ​In-place​ ​Analytics​ ​(3​ ​claims)
U.S.​ ​Patent​ ​Application​ ​No.:​ ​ ​ ​158254438

In September 2016, three related patents were filed together (U.S. Patent Application No.:
2209340.00126US1US1) as a comprehensive provisional application, and we will pull out
each one individually and file utility patents for each in September 2017. These three
independent​ ​claims,​ ​with​ ​numerous​ ​dependent​ ​claims,​ ​are​ ​as​ ​follows:
1. Insights Page – a dynamic “second page” on web or mobile pages, along with new
ad​ ​inventory

15

2. Smart Profiling & Data Presentation System -- creates a psychographic profile for
each respondent on a 2x2 matrix, that then triggers intelligent presentation of data to
each​ ​Web​ ​viewer.
3. In-place Analytics -- end-users and administrators can click to see analytics from
within​ ​that​ ​particular​ ​widget,​ ​in​ ​situ.
This majority of 1World’s patent portfolio is themed around inherent higher engagement for
web publishers—or the measurement of this engagement-- based on relevant and
supporting information to an initial and main content topic. The power of the 1World system
is the interactivity and choice of navigation, choice of what to read or consume, and
simultaneously the opportunity for web publishers of data to enhance the information
gathering and understanding process, which in turn allows for ever-increasing engagement
with the content. And in the case the Dynamic Analytics Research Engine-- a normalization
algorithm patent (known as “DRP”)-- the information gathering and understanding can
provide scientifically sound research results as well; this research objective is further
strengthened by the “Chains of Polls as a Unique Data Collection Engine” patent that
focuses on the method of data collection over time and in different venues (web, mobile,
print,​ ​etc.)
“Engagement” describes the interest in interacting with the digital content and interactive
elements presented to end-users, such as voting on a poll in a 1World Poller widget or
clicking on “Learn More” after one has voted. Content engagement is also associated with
better comprehension and processing of the material, better enjoyment of the subject
matter, and increased statistics of web viewing such as more time on the web site (section of
the site, technically) and/or more monetization achieved by more, and more relevant,
advertisements​ ​able​ ​to​ ​be​ ​displayed--and​ ​thus​ ​higher​ ​CPMs​ ​can​ ​be​ ​commanded.
1World’s inventions listed thus help achieve higher engagement with the content being
presented to the end-user. Looking just at the most recent patent filing in September 2016
to make the point, the additional Insight pages – and/or additional information in-situ within
the spot on the web page (In-place Analytics) – of insights from the poll or other “interactive
elements of choice” results, or putting web pages of data through a filter depending on their

16

psychographic outlooks and worldviews (Smart Profiling & Data Presentation System), and all
three of these inventions can be applied simultaneously. The expected result of using these
innovations is even higher engagement, a positive spiral where publisher editors, web site
readers,​ ​and​ ​monetization​ ​goals​ ​all​ ​benefit.
Web publishers have a keen interest in raising engagement rates of their content. The shift
in the publishing industry from print format to an online publishing medium has brought a
revolution in the way news is produced and consumed. But along with this transformation of
the publishing industry comes challenges. The low entry barrier, outdated tools, declining ad
revenue, and the decimation of the once profitable classified sections of newspapers, and
continuous change in search engine algorithms, combined with short-attention span of the
online audiences has caused major industry problems. It has forced many online publishers
to go out of business or desperately search ways to increase online engagement rates so as
to stay in business, either by content subscriptions from avid fans (committed readers) of the
content provider or online advertising to readers on their website or mobile app. These
innovations listed above all are meant to address the problems facing web publishers by
helping them increase their engagement rates with each individual end-user web visitor, and
in​ ​turn​ ​generate​ ​more​ ​revenue​ ​and​ ​profits.

17

1World​ ​Cryptocurrency​ ​&​ ​Use​ ​Cases
1World Online will be introducing its own cryptocurrency called ​1WO ​(pronounced as
one-world​).

1WO Token is an internal cryptocurrency circulated inside the ecosystem that 1World Online
has created and continues to grow. All payments inside such an ecosystem will be
conducted only via 1WO Tokens. For a convenient exchange of 1WO Tokens into fiat and
various popular cryptocurrencies there will be references to external marketplace such as
Coin​ ​Exchanges​ ​where​ ​1WO​ ​coins​ ​will​ ​be​ ​listed​ ​after​ ​the​ ​ICO.
The issuance of 1WO currency is capped at 160 Million tokens and no additional issuances
are​ ​planned.
From the very beginning the issued token mass is designed to support the growing volume
of transactions inside of the ecosystem during the scaling, which implies ongoing organic
growth​ ​of​ ​the​ ​1WO​ ​Token​ ​buying​ ​power.
The tokens could be split up to 8th decimal point position, so the growth of their value won’t
be​ ​a​ ​problem​ ​for​ ​processing​ ​transactions​ ​of​ ​any​ ​viable​ ​size​ ​within​ ​1World​ ​Online​ ​ecosystem.
The following base use cases covering all three participants of the ​Triangle​: ​Readers →
Publishers​ ​→​ ​Advertisers

Readers’​ ​Use​ ​Cases
End users on the site can earn these tokens by collecting points for engagements and
contributions. First these earnings are coming in the format of points, which are already
implemented in the 1World Platform and have functioned for years as a standard feature
reflecting the amount of user activities. Upon reaching a designated threshold, these points
will​ ​be​ ​converted​ ​into​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​as​ ​soon​ ​as​ ​the​ ​ ​ ​user​ ​registers​ ​and​ ​creates​ ​a​ ​wallet.

18

Then spending and use of earned tokens can be done either inside of the 1World system or
outside​ ​of​ ​it.​ ​Inside,​ ​users​ ​will​ ​be​ ​offered​ ​a​ ​few​ ​pre-defined​ ​choices:
a)

Use 1WO coins for ​micropayments to disable advertising ​and still enjoy the

content. This case solves the fundamental problem when readers with Ad Blockers
are warned by the site they are visiting that content isn’t available until ad blocker is
turned off or a subscription payment received. 1World will make such
micropayments seamless and establish a proper user experience that works for
both​ ​the​ ​publisher​ ​and​ ​the​ ​reader.
b)

Use 1WO coins to purchase Advertising space and / or ​initiate Data collection
service (Mini-surveys) via 1World widgets. This operation is handled via a built-in
Marketplace​ ​with​ ​one​ ​of​ ​our​ ​partners,​ ​CINT.

c)

Redeem 1WO coins at the online store ​that accepts tokens for their goods via an

easy one-click transition from their 1World User Profile to the respective Landing
Page;
d)

Take earned 1WO coins outside of the system, e.g. to a ​Coin Exchange ​that accepts
1WO​ ​tokens​ ​and​ ​sell​ ​them​ ​there​ ​(Secondary​ ​Markets).

1World’s​ ​current​ ​detailed​ ​scoring​ ​(points-based)​ ​system​ ​is​ ​described​ ​in​ ​the​ ​next​ ​section.
Conversion from points to tokens will be different for different sites and determined by a
COT ​(​Coefficient of Transformation​). It will depend on site reputation, volume of traffic, and

related factors. Initially COT will be established by the 1World Team with a help of Advisory
Board that includes top media experts. Then an algorithm will be developed, as indicated in
the 1Word Roadmap, to make such calculations and adjustments automated and
well-balanced.

19

Publisher’s​ ​Use​ ​Cases
Publishers will be accepting 1World Tokens (coins) based on the following motivation and
principles:
●

Sell​ ​remnant​ ​inventory​ ​for​ ​tokens​ ​(as​ ​otherwise​ ​there​ ​is​ ​zero​ ​dollars​ ​from​ ​it)

●

Enable​ ​readers​ ​to​ ​earn​ ​and​ ​spend​ ​tokens,​ ​thus​ ​drastically​ ​increasing​ ​retention​ ​rates

●

Provide​ ​an​ ​option​ ​to​ ​allow​ ​10%​ ​of​ ​Ads​ ​revenue​ ​received​ ​via​ ​1World​ ​service​ ​go​ ​to
readers,​ ​and​ ​1World​ ​will​ ​match​ ​it​ ​(subject​ ​of​ ​approval)

On top of all this, publishers will be receiving all of the standard benefits associated with the
use of 1World’s Platform such as increase of User Engagement and growth of key metrics
such as time on site and number of visited pages, Smart Content (such as Poll results with
Interactive​ ​Maps,​ ​Infographics​ ​and​ ​other​ ​auto-generated​ ​Insights),​ ​and​ ​advertising​ ​revenue.

Advertiser’s​ ​Use​ ​Cases
Advertisers will be paying for running ad campaigns with 1World Tokens (coins) or fiat (such
as​ ​US​ ​dollars)​ ​based​ ​on​ ​the​ ​following​ ​principles:
● Get​ ​discounts​ ​for​ ​using​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​(versus​ ​cash​ ​or​ ​other​ ​equivalents)
● Have​ ​access​ ​to​ ​1World​ ​network​ ​of​ ​sites​ ​(clusters)​ ​supporting​ ​1W​ ​widgets
● Have​ ​the​ ​ability​ ​to​ ​ask​ ​questions,​ ​receive​ ​feedback​ ​during​ ​the​ ​campaign
● Have​ ​ability​ ​to​ ​profile​ ​their​ ​audience​ ​thus​ ​increasing​ ​targeting​ ​efficiency

20

Mechanics​ ​of​ ​work​ ​will​ ​be​ ​as​ ​following:
1. At the entrance to 1World system, there is a marketplace where a client (brand, agency or
an individual) can buy tokens for Fiat and Crypto currency. These tokens could be also
earned​ ​via​ ​engagements​ ​(also​ ​called​ ​“mining”)
2. Prices for advertising in the system are set in dollars and are driven by publishers, but
aggregated​ ​and​ ​presented​ ​by​ ​1World
3. To pay for accommodation, client must purchase tokens and pay for them in accordance
with​ ​the​ ​current​ ​exchange​ ​rate​ ​of​ ​the​ ​token​ ​to​ ​the​ ​dollar
4. Once tokens are purchased, campaign is launched per purchased volume of impressions
and​ ​targeting,​ ​all​ ​driven​ ​by​ ​1World​ ​platform​ ​and​ ​its​ ​campaign​ ​management​ ​system;
5. Upon​ ​campaign​ ​completion,​ ​an​ ​automatic​ ​report​ ​is​ ​generated​ ​and​ ​delivered​ ​to​ ​the​ ​client;
6. Tokens for the campaign now are in possession of the Publisher and 1World based on
the business rules; usually it’s Revenue Share model, possibly reflected in Smart
Contracts;
7. Publisher has a choice to hold Tokens upon campaign completion (if they expect their
value / price to grow) or use an external exchange (conveniently plugged in) to convert to
fiat​ ​/​ ​other​ ​crypto​ ​currency.

* During the campaign users who get involved receive respective rewards with Tokens at the current
token​ ​exchange​ ​rate​ ​to​ ​the​ ​dollar​ ​and​ ​are​ ​calculated​ ​based​ ​on​ ​dollar​ ​prices

The​ ​volume​ ​of​ ​emission​ ​of​ ​tokens​ ​is​ ​strictly​ ​limited​ ​to​ ​the​ ​framework​ ​set​ ​forth​ ​in​ ​the​ ​ICO.

21

With the growth of the system's turnover, the price of the token is expected to grow
naturally; the original limited mass of tokens will be providing the foundation for an
increasing​ ​value​ ​of​ ​transactions.
Thanks to the growing token exchange rate, we expect to address the challenge of queues
for advertising placements. The advertiser, who has tokens, can pay for their
accommodation right away or wait for these tokens to grow in price in order to get more
volume​ ​of​ ​placement.
In addition, the total capitalization of the token-mass (in dollars) is expected to grow, which in
some​ ​ways​ ​makes​ ​this​ ​ICO​ ​a​ ​vehicle​ ​for​ ​bringing​ ​continuous​ ​benefits​ ​to​ ​token-holders.

Why​ ​Blockchain?
There are many reasons why 1World platform transition to use Blockchain is the right
strategic path and a very organic and natural fit for the product developed and deployed
since​ ​2012:
1. 1World​ ​is​ ​already​ ​implemented​ ​as​ ​a​ ​distributed​ ​and​ ​partially​ ​decentralized​ ​system

where​ ​1W​ ​widgets​ ​are​ ​running​ ​on​ ​many​ ​sites,​ ​in​ ​many​ ​languages​ ​and​ ​many​ ​countries
and​ ​support​ ​sophisticated​ ​mechanisms​ ​if​ ​information​ ​exchange,​ ​e.g.​ ​ability​ ​to​ ​do

“Compare​ ​&​ ​Contrast”​ ​of​ ​public​ ​opinion​ ​on​ ​polls​ ​that​ ​are​ ​tagged​ ​as​ ​“public”​ ​and​ ​are

available​ ​to​ ​many​ ​audiences​ ​on​ ​many​ ​sites.​ ​Now​ ​the​ ​platform​ ​is​ ​transitioning​ ​to​ ​even

more​ ​powerful​ ​model​ ​where​ ​established​ ​mechanisms​ ​can​ ​operate​ ​in​ ​peer-to-peer​ ​mode
and​ ​have​ ​less​ ​(or​ ​eventually​ ​no)​ ​dependency​ ​on​ ​central​ ​server.

2. 1World​ ​already​ ​has​ ​a​ ​scoring​ ​system​ ​used​ ​primarily​ ​for​ ​gamification,​ ​that​ ​is​ ​based​ ​on

engagement​ ​and​ ​contributions​ ​by​ ​site​ ​audiences.​ ​Transitioning​ ​this​ ​system​ ​to​ ​Tokens
makes​ ​incentives​ ​more​ ​material​ ​and​ ​leads​ ​to​ ​wider​ ​acceptance​ ​of​ ​all​ ​ecosystem
participants.

3. There​ ​is​ ​a​ ​huge​ ​benefit​ ​to​ ​use​​ ​Blockchain​ ​ID​ ​to​ ​identify​ ​users​ ​in​ ​the​ ​1World​ ​ecosystem

instead​ ​of​ ​relying​ ​on​ ​cookies,​ ​an​ ​old​ ​and​ ​increasingly​ ​unreliable​ ​technology,​ ​especially
22

for​ ​readers​ ​who​ ​start​ ​their​ ​engagement​ ​anonymously​ ​and​ ​they​ ​decide​ ​to​ ​register​ ​in
order​ ​to​ ​earn​ ​tokens​ ​and,​ ​at​ ​some​ ​point,​ ​to​ ​redeem​ ​them.

4. 1World​ ​connects​ ​services,​ ​such​ ​as​ ​advertising​ ​and​ ​research​ ​to​ ​audiences​ ​and​ ​is

essentially​ ​serving​ ​as​ ​a​ ​layer​ ​to​ ​facilitate​ ​many​ ​marketplaces​ ​and​ ​many​ ​competing

offerings​ ​coming​ ​from​ ​these​ ​marketplaces.​ ​Using​ ​Smart​ ​Contracts​ ​for​ ​such​ ​operations
makes​ ​the​ ​platform​ ​operation​ ​robust​ ​and​ ​transparent​ ​and​ ​therefore​ ​putting​ ​it​ ​on​ ​the
public​ ​decentralized​ ​ledger​ ​is​ ​the​ ​best​ ​approach​ ​to​ ​grow​ ​the​ ​business.

Overall​ ​there​ ​is​ ​fast​ ​growing​ ​set​ ​of​ ​Blockchain-based​ ​services,​ ​applications,​ ​and
technologies​ ​so​ ​it​ ​make​ ​sense​ ​to​ ​have​ ​it​ ​utilized​ ​not​ ​only​ ​for​ ​the​ ​immediate​ ​opportunities,
but​ ​also​ ​for​ ​future​ ​use​ ​cases.

23

The​ ​1World​ ​Economy
The 1World decentralized economy is already developed and will be built further around the
concept of connecting audiences on variety of websites with services from various
providers,​ ​including,​ ​but​ ​not​ ​limited​ ​to:
● Advertising​:​ ​(programmatic​ ​ads​ ​and​ ​direct​ ​deals)
● Research​:​ ​via​ ​Commercial​ ​Polls​ ​and​ ​“Mini-Surveys”
● Traffic​:​ ​tools​ ​for​ ​generating​ ​traffic​ ​to​ ​and​ ​from​ ​other​ ​sites
● Data​ ​exchange​:​ ​passing​ ​information​ ​to​ ​third​ ​party​ ​analytics​ ​systems,​ ​such​ ​as​ ​DMP
● TBD​ ​future​ ​services​ ​that​ ​also​ ​can​ ​be​ ​routed​ ​via​ ​1World​ ​widgets

24

World​ ​Points​ ​System​ ​Today
1World’s​ ​Loyalty​ ​and​ ​Gamification​ ​system​ ​used​ ​since​ ​2013:

1World​ ​Wallet
The 1World Wallet will be established for all registered users and allows them to earn and
spend​ ​their​ ​tokens​ ​within​ ​the​ ​1World​ ​ecosystem

Expansion​ ​with​ ​More​ ​Use​ ​Cases
It is expected that 1World will be adding new types of engagements and new associated
services that will run inside deployed widgets and give even more opportunities to earn and
spend points and then convert the monetary gains to 1WO Tokens. This type of new
operations​ ​will​ ​be​ ​supported​ ​in​ ​future​ ​releases​ ​of​ ​1World​ ​software.

25

1World​ ​Token​ ​Issuance

1World​ ​Token​ ​Allocations
During​ ​the​ ​ICO​ ​for​ ​each​ ​one​ ​(1)​ ​Token​ ​sold​ ​in​ ​open​ ​sale:
● 1​ ​Token​ ​will​ ​be​ ​issued​ ​for​ ​mining​ ​to​ ​Publishers​ ​and​ ​Partners
● 0.2​ ​Token​ ​will​ ​be​ ​issued​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Team​ ​and​ ​Advisors​ ​/​ ​Bounty​ ​program
● 1​ ​Token​ ​will​ ​be​ ​allocated​ ​and​ ​placed​ ​to​ ​Reserve​ ​(aka,​ ​Liquidity​ ​pool)
As​ ​a​ ​result,​ ​allocation​ ​of​ ​1World​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​will​ ​be​ ​as​ ​following:

Escrow
Minimum​ ​ICO​ ​target​ ​will​ ​be​ ​set​ ​as​ ​$5​ ​Million
● If​ ​less​ ​money​ ​is​ ​raised,​ ​then​ ​all​ ​of​ ​proceeds​ ​will​ ​be​ ​returned​ ​within​ ​one​ ​month​ ​after
the​ ​ICO​ ​completion
27

● If​ ​a​ ​force​ ​majeure​ ​occurs​ ​in​ ​tokens​ ​issuance,​ ​funds​ ​will​ ​be​ ​returned​ ​to​ ​buyers​ ​within
two​ ​months
For the 1World ICO program, an escrow account will be set-up and utilized, managed by a
Los​ ​Angeles-based​ ​provider​ ​Blockchain​ ​Law​ ​Group
The funds will be released from escrow to 1World Online upon hitting the $5M target and
after​ ​the​ ​distribution​ ​of​ ​tokens.

Supply​ ​Schedule
Initial Token supply will be a maximum of up to 110 Million tokens (50 Million direct sale + 50
Million for mining and 10 Million for the Team and Advisors) and will be distributed upon ICO
completion​ ​on​ ​or​ ​around​ ​November​ ​16,​ ​2017.
Periodic Token transition out of reserve to support the company growth starting from Year
2018 will be based on the business needs and tokens will be either sold on open market or
allocated to publishers and partners for their audiences to mine them via engagement. It will
be done per the same rules as outlined earlier for the original ICO in Year 2017 via the
Scoring system and COT (​Coefficient of Transformation​) adjusting conversion of earned
points​ ​to​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​per​ ​publisher.

In order to sustain a robust economy for its tokens and to facilitate token value growth
1World plans to launch a new Tier 1 media holding company (a publisher with many digital
sites and multi-million audiences) every quarter to support this economy. This approach will
support​ ​the​ ​“smooth​ ​token​ ​growth”​ ​model​ ​with​ ​a​ ​virtual​ ​“corridor”​ ​established.

Payments​ ​Processing
Token buyers must register at tokensale.icobox.io, entering and confirming their email
address. After the registration, users gain access to their personal accounts at
tokensale.icobox.io where they will have separate wallets for BTC, ETH, LTC, Dash, Zcash,
ETC, or USD. In their accounts users can choose the desired number of 1WO Tokens and
28

transfer the required payment amount in one of the accepted cryptocurrencies or generate
an​ ​invoice​ ​for​ ​a​ ​wire​ ​transfer.
Once the payment is received, funds will appear in the corresponding wallet in the user’s
account and may be used for purchasing 1WO Tokens. Until the token purchase is made, the
funds may be withdrawn from the account at tokensale.icobox.io at any moment by sending
a request to ​support@1worldonline.com​. Tokens are purchased at the price in effect at the
time of purchasing, not at the price in effect at the time when funds have been sent or

received by the platform. When buying tokens with currency other than BTC, the exchange
rate​ ​is​ ​fixed​ ​at​ ​the​ ​time​ ​of​ ​token​ ​purchase.
Accounts at tokensale.1worldonline.com will be accessible several days before the start of
the 1WO token sale. Users will be able to sign up and make transfers to their 1WO accounts,
but will not have the option to buy 1WO Tokens with deposited funds until the start of the
1WO Token presale. To take part in the public presale, a buyer will need to purchase at least
the specified minimum number of 1WO tokens (10,000 or 1,000 1WO Tokens, depending on
the date and time of purchase). The general 1WO Token sale has no minimum entrance
threshold, except for the minimum transfer amount specified by the relevant blockchain or
bank​ ​used​ ​by​ ​the​ ​buyer.
After the token purchase is complete, the information about 1WO Tokens credited to the
1WO​ ​buyers​ ​should​ ​appear​ ​in​ ​their​ ​accounts​ ​at​ ​tokensale.1worldonline.com​​ ​immediately.

Token​ ​Distribution​ ​Event
After the 1WO Token sale is over, a personal account will be automatically generated at
ico.1worldonline.com for every 1WO Token holder. 1WO tokens will be issued and transferred
to​ ​these​ ​accounts.
Once this step is complete, 1WO Token holders may at any time transfer their 1WO Tokens to
any​ ​third-party​ ​ETH​ ​wallet​ ​supporting​ ​ERC-20​ ​standard.

29

BTC and wire transfer proceeds from the 1World 1WO Token sale during the ICO Sale will be
deposited in escrow where they will be kept in BTC and USD. Supported original payments
made in other cryptocurrencies will be accumulated, converted to BTC, and also deposited
in​ ​escrow​ ​on​ ​a​ ​regular​ ​basis.

Token​ ​Distribution​ ​for​ ​the​ ​Team
After the 1WO tokens become available to the team (7% of overall allocation, which is 20% of
the​ ​original​ ​open​ ​sale),​ ​they​ ​will​ ​be​ ​distributed​ ​as​ ​following:
● 1World​ ​Core​ ​Team:​ ​up​ ​to​ ​50%
● Advisors​ ​&​ ​Key​ ​ICO​ ​Contributors:​ ​up​ ​to​ ​20%
● Bounty​ ​Program:​ ​up​ ​to​ ​10%
● Reserve:​ ​Up​ ​to​ ​20%
* 1World reserves the right to direct these funds to certain areas based on specific ICO development
to​ ​maximize​ ​the​ ​efficiency​ ​and​ ​increase​ ​the​ ​Token​ ​sales.

Use​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Proceeds
1World​ ​plans​ ​the​ ​following​ ​use​ ​of​ ​the​ ​proceeds​ ​collected​ ​in​ ​the​ ​ICO​ ​Open​ ​Sale:
● Up​ ​to​ ​30%​ ​-​ ​Core​ ​US​ ​Team:​ ​Business​ ​/​ ​Marketing​ ​/​ ​Customer​ ​Success
● Up​ ​to​ ​25%​ ​-​ ​R&D​ ​and​ ​Technical​ ​support
● Up​ ​to​ ​20%​ ​-​ ​Global​ ​Expansion
● Up​ ​to​ ​10%​ ​-​ ​Legal,​ ​IP​ ​and​ ​other​ ​services
● Up​ ​to​ ​5%​ ​-​ ​PR​ ​/​ ​Events​ ​/​ ​Promotions
● Up​ ​to​ ​10%​ ​-​ ​Reserve​ ​/​ ​Miscellaneous
* 1World reserves the right to direct these funds to certain areas based on business opportunities
and​ ​market​ ​situation​ ​with​ ​the​ ​goal​ ​of​ ​growing​ ​both​ ​business​ ​and​ ​company​ ​valuations​ ​in​ ​mind,

30

Technical​ ​implementation
Technical implementation aspects of the 1World economy and cryptocurrency are outlined in
the​ ​following​ ​diagram:

31

At the beginning 1WO Tokens will be implemented as a combination of public on-chain
Ethereum blockchain, and off-chain solution like Raiden, Plasma or State channels (or private
blockchain​ ​solution​ ​like​ ​Exonum).
Users (brands, publishers, researchers, readers) who want to transfer 1WO Tokens will be
able to interact with the public Ethereum blockchain, which will serve as the currency’s
decentralized​ ​settlement​ ​layer.

Implementation​ ​Based​ ​on​ ​Ethereum​ ​ERC20
The Ethereum blockchain is currently the industry standard for issuing custom digital assets
and smart contracts. One of the main reasons is using existing Ethereum’s infrastructure
instead of building an entirely new blockchain. The latest and most popular ERC20 token
interface is the best choice compatible with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum
ecosystem, development tools, wallets, and exchanges. Also ERC20 allows for seamless
interaction with other smart contracts and decentralized applications on the Ethereum
blockchain.

Current​ ​Ethereum​ ​Limitations
Blockchain in general (and Ethereum blockchain in particular) is a decentralized network.
Decentralization is critical because it eliminates single points of failure or control that makes
downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference impossible. These advantages and
active ecosystem make Ethereum a good choice for the 1World decentralized economy. But,
on the other hand, the nature of blockchain decentralization (Signature verification,
Consensus mechanisms, Redundancy, etc.) leads to some disadvantages in comparison with
centralized databases. The biggest Ethereum disadvantage for proposed 1World economy is
Ethereum​ ​scalability.

32

The well-known fact is the current Ethereum Proof-of-Work blockchain has scalability
bottlenecks:
● a​ ​fee​ ​to​ ​be​ ​paid​ ​for​ ​every​ ​single​ ​transaction
● a​ ​transactions​ ​confirmation​ ​takes​ ​tens​ ​of​ ​seconds​ ​in​ ​average
● a number of transactions per second (transaction throughput) that is small enough to
process​ ​increasing​ ​number​ ​of​ ​applications
These limitations make micro-transactions, such as the ones the 1World Online platform
performs for typical use cases, not economically viable to put on the public ledger and be
charged. An example would be 1WO Tokens to reward end-users on the site for their
engagements​ ​and​ ​content​ ​contributions.
​ ​If​ ​a​ ​public​ ​Ethereum​ ​blockchain​ ​is​ ​used​ ​‘as​ ​is’​ ​for​ ​these​ ​transactions,​ ​then:
●

a​ ​fee​ ​for​ ​transaction​ ​would​ ​be​ ​comparable​ ​or​ ​even​ ​higher​ ​than​ ​reward​ ​amount​ ​itself;

●

end-users​ ​would​ ​wait​ ​for​ ​tens​ ​of​ ​seconds​ ​until​ ​transaction​ ​is​ ​confirmed;

●

huge number of 1WO transaction would congest the Ethereum’s throughput
capability.

That’s why 1World Online could not use the existing version of public Ethereum blockchain
‘as is’ for some kinds of transactions and has to find some solution. There is no silver bullet
here and now, but Ethereum is a new technology, a lot of efforts are made to solve these
Ethereum’s limitations. For example, the core Ethereum team understands the limitations
and is trying to solve them: a recent Ethereum Metropolis hard fork is a first step in transition
from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. Moreover a lot of other solutions on the top of
Ethereum are in progress. And most experts agree that this is only the question of time:
some solution or combination of solutions will be developed as is often the case with
evolving​ ​technology.
This concerns not Ethereum blockchain only. The similar issues for the Bitcoin blockchain, a
crypto currency network older than Ethereum, have been successfully solved by ​Lightning
Network​.

33

There are several solutions that are going to solve these blockchain bottlenecks like
Machinomy​, ​Toy State Channels and other, but a few of them are worth to be mentioning in
detail:

● Raiden​ ​network
● Plasma
● Smart​ ​contracts
● Exonum

Raiden​ ​Network
Raiden network is similar to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network - off-chain high speed asset
transfers network for Ethereum ERC20 tokens that has been under development now for
nearly two years and is close to release. It uses a network of off-chain state channels to
securely transfer any ERC20 token without the requirement to transact on the blockchain.
The Raiden Network will provide a payment system based on payment channel technology
that scales with the number of its users: the bigger the Raiden Network becomes, the higher
its​ ​maximum​ ​throughput​ ​will​ ​be,​ ​with​ ​practically​ ​no​ ​upper​ ​limit​ ​in​ ​sight.
One more important thing: unlike Ethereum public transactions, Raiden transfers will be
private between the payer, the payee, and the nodes forwarding the transfer. When
channels​ ​are​ ​settled,​ ​only​ ​the​ ​sum​ ​of​ ​transactions​ ​will​ ​become​ ​visible​ ​to​ ​the​ ​entire​ ​world.

Plasma
The ​Plasma solution was recently announced by Joseph Poon and Vitalik Buterin; it is a

framework that is scalable to a significant amount of state updates by using the
Proof-of-Stake method. Plasma works on top of a root (main) Ethereum blockchain. Its idea is
to eliminate the need to generate on-chain transactions for every state update by leveraging
coalesced state updates that are comprised of the bitmaps in which the transactions are
composed. The root network contract processes only a very small number of commitments

34

from child blockchains that are able to do a large number of computations. Commitments are
broadcasted​ ​periodically​ ​to​ ​the​ ​root​ ​blockchain​ ​from​ ​the​ ​child​ ​blockchains.

State​ ​Channels
In addition to open-source solutions like Plasma or Raiden, 1World Online could implement
their​ ​own​ ​solution​ ​that​ ​utilizes​ ​State​ ​channels​ ​for​ ​appropriate​ ​transactions.
State Channels are a design pattern in which signed messages representing transactions
are exchanged between two parties. Any party can choose at any time to broadcast the last
message to the blockchain, updating it to a state representative of the sum of all exchanges
between​ ​the​ ​two​ ​parties.
State channels are an important technique for allowing some blockchain operations to be
conducted off of the blockchain, while retaining or even improving the underlying security
guarantees​ ​that​ ​a​ ​blockchain​ ​offers.
In particular, state channels can be used to significantly improve the performance of
interactions between a designated group of people, while significantly reducing transaction
costs.​ ​They​ ​can​ ​be​ ​applied​ ​to​ ​payments,​ ​smart​ ​contracts,​ ​and​ ​many​ ​other​ ​scenarios.​ ​[9]

Exonum
Exonum is an open source enterprise-grade blockchain framework developed by the Bitfury
Group. It allows to build a private or permissioned blockchain. At the moment,
Exonum-based smart contracts can handle 3,000 transactions per second with a clearing
time of 2.5 seconds (and up to 15,000 transactions per second in custom situations), that is
significantly faster than any other public Blockchain networks. It uses custom-built Byzantine
Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm that excludes any single point of failure, making
blockchain​ ​resilient​ ​to​ ​nodes​ ​crashes​ ​or​ ​bad​ ​actors,​ ​without​ ​needing​ ​to​ ​mine​ ​blocks.
Exonum seems to be a perfect solution for 1World’s micro-transactions, but there is a one
significant obstacle: it anchors (periodically saves a cryptographic hash reflecting the state of
35

Exonum Blockchain) data to the Bitcoin blockchain in order to protect data against history
revisions. But 1WO is Ethereum token and thus this will require to develop some extra
module​ ​that​ ​allows​ ​to​ ​use​ ​Exonum​ ​together​ ​with​ ​Ethereum​ ​blockchain.

Smart​ ​Contracts
1World will utilize Smart Contract for appropriate transactions, both for Engagement and
Services​ ​Delivery​ ​(Advertising​ ​and​ ​Research)​ ​use​ ​cases​ ​as​ ​described​ ​in​ ​this​ ​document.

Current​ ​Implementation​ ​Plan
It is highly expected that there will be others solutions that also could be used for 1World
Online purposes. The common idea is to switch from saving all transactions on the public
blockchain (on-chain) to saving them off-chain but ultimately enforceable on-chain. Moving
transactions off of the chain leads to significant improvements in cost and speed. Anyway,
there is a strong confidence that there will be at least one solution on top of Ethereum in the
near​ ​future​ ​that​ ​allows​ ​highly​ ​scalable,​ ​low​ ​latency,​ ​and​ ​cost​ ​effective​ ​decentralized​ ​systems.

Use​ ​Cases​ ​for​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens
For further consideration, it makes sense to separate 1World transactions based on their
size,​ ​quantity,​ ​and​ ​the​ ​role​ ​of​ ​involved​ ​persons​ ​into:
● Reader​ ​micro-transactions​ ​to​ ​earn​ ​1W​ ​points​ ​/​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens
● Reader​ ​micro-transactions​ ​to​ ​spend​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens
● Brands​ ​or​ ​Research​ ​related​ ​transactions
● Publisher’s​ ​transactions

36

Reader​ ​(end-users)​ ​micro-transactions​ ​to​ ​earn​ ​1W​ ​points​ ​/​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens
Micro-transactions in 1World widgets on publishers’ websites happen when site visitors
(readers)​ ​earn​ ​1WO​ ​points​ ​for:
● voting,​ ​sharing,​ ​click​ ​Read-More​ ​or​ ​Learn-More,​ ​or​ ​other​ ​related​ ​engagement​ ​actions;
● poll​ ​creation​ ​or​ ​other​ ​contributions;
● voting​ ​commercial​ ​polls​ ​or​ ​taking​ ​commercial​ ​mini-surveys;
● watching​ ​video​ ​ads;
● sign up to 1World Online by using email address or social sign-in (Facebook, Twitter,
etc.);
● entering​ ​any​ ​of​ ​their​ ​profile​ ​info​ ​(gender,​ ​age,​ ​marital​ ​status,​ ​etc);
1World widgets will display how many 1WO points have been collected by current users,
explain their value and suggest converting them to 1W Tokens. In order to convert points to
tokens​ ​the​ ​user​ ​needs​ ​to:
● earn​ ​500​ ​(subject​ ​to​ ​refinement)​ ​1WO​ ​points;
● sign up to 1World Online by using email address (and verify email address) or social
sign-in​ ​(Facebook,​ ​Twitter,​ ​etc).
● Enter​ ​his/her​ ​wallet​ ​address
Conversion​ ​from​ ​1WO​ ​points​ ​to​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​will​ ​be​ ​made​ ​by​ ​conversion​ ​rate.
This​ ​rate​ ​is​ ​not​ ​fixed​ ​and​ ​depends​ ​on:
● 1WO​ ​Token​ ​price​ ​at​ ​the​ ​moment​ ​of​ ​conversion;
● a special publisher coefficient that is calculated by 1World Online algorithm based on
its​ ​content,​ ​audience,​ ​etc.;
● a​ ​special​ ​geo-coefficient​ ​for​ ​the​ ​user’s​ ​location;
● a​ ​time​ ​period​ ​when​ ​the​ ​points​ ​were​ ​earned.

37

After the conversion the user gets access to his/her own ‘My Wallet’ page with current
balance, transaction history, etc. Also all future 1WO points earned, once they reach the
established​ ​threshold,​ ​are​ ​immediately​ ​converted​ ​to​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​and​ ​added​ ​to​ ​user’s​ ​wallet.
Because of current Ethereum PoW limitations (described above) all these micro-transactions
are saved off-chain but ultimately enforceable on-chain by using Plasma, Raiden, Exonum or
similar​ ​solution.

Reader​ ​micro-transactions​ ​to​ ​spend​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens
Micro-transactions​ ​also​ ​happen​ ​when​ ​readers​ ​spend​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​points​ ​for:
● convert​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​to​ ​perks;
● pay​ ​publisher​ ​so​ ​as​ ​to​ ​not​ ​see​ ​advertisements​ ​during​ ​a​ ​week​ ​or​ ​a​ ​month;
● pay​ ​publisher​ ​to​ ​get​ ​access​ ​to​ ​paid​ ​content;
● donate​ ​to​ ​the​ ​author​ ​of​ ​the​ ​blog​ ​or​ ​some​ ​particular​ ​article.
All​ ​these​ ​micro-transactions​ ​are​ ​also​ ​saved​ ​off-chain​ ​but​ ​ultimately​ ​enforceable​ ​on-chain.

Brands​ ​or​ ​Research​ ​related​ ​transactions
Another​ ​type​ ​of​ ​transactions​ ​happen​ ​when​ ​brands​ ​or​ ​researchers​ ​spend​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​for:
● running​ ​direct​ ​deals​ ​campaign
● running​ ​commercial​ ​polls​ ​or​ ​commercial​ ​mini-surveys
These transactions will be made from 1World Online Client Dashboard as a public Ethereum
on-chain​ ​transactions​ ​because:
● the​ ​transaction​ ​amount​ ​is​ ​big​ ​enough​ ​when​ ​compared​ ​with​ ​the​ ​transaction​ ​fee
● brands​ ​or​ ​researchers​ ​could​ ​wait​ ​tens​ ​of​ ​seconds​ ​for​ ​a​ ​transaction​ ​confirmation
● they will happen much less often than readers micro-transactions and will not affect
Ethereum​ ​transaction​ ​throughput​ ​significantly

38

Publishers​ ​transactions
Publishers​ ​earn​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​for:
● their​ ​inventory​ ​used​ ​for​ ​direct​ ​deals​ ​campaigns
● their​ ​inventory​ ​used​ ​for​ ​commercial​ ​polls​ ​or​ ​commercial​ ​mini-surveys
● not​ ​displaying​ ​advertisement​ ​to​ ​some​ ​particular​ ​readers
● providing​ ​access​ ​to​ ​paid​ ​content​ ​to​ ​some​ ​particular​ ​readers
In​ ​case​ ​of​ ​direct​ ​deal​ ​campaigns​ ​transactions​ ​will​ ​be​ ​made​ ​in​ ​a​ ​public​ ​Ethereum​ ​on-chain.
All other transactions are saved off-chain but ultimately enforceable on-chain by using
Plasma, Raiden, Exonum or similar solution. In addition to standard enforcing methods
provided by off-chain solution, the off-chain transactions will be enforced to on-chain when
there​ ​is​ ​a​ ​big​ ​enough​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens​ ​for​ ​this​ ​particular​ ​publisher.

1World​ ​Reward​ ​Engine
The 1World Reward Engine will follow the implementation already done and released in
version​ ​2.x.

1World​ ​Campaigns​ ​Management
The​ ​1World​ ​Campaigns​ ​Management​ ​implementation​ ​will​ ​be​ ​part​ ​of​ ​Release​ ​3.0.

Identity​ ​Management​ ​&​ ​DID
Identity Management & DID will be further researched and released in future versions of
software.

Risk​ ​factors
The acquisition of Tokens involves a high degree of risk, including but not limited to the risks
described​ ​below.
Before acquiring tokens, it is recommended that each participant carefully weighs all the
information​ ​and​ ​risks​ ​detailed​ ​in​ ​this​ ​White​ ​Paper,​ ​and,​ ​specifically,​ ​the​ ​following​ ​risk​ ​factors.

Dependence​ ​on​ ​publishers​ ​and​ ​their​ ​advertising​ ​practices
1World’s business is dependent on existing advertising markets with its very complex
infrastructure and existing policies and practices related to programmatic and direct
advertisement, certain requirements for performance, reporting, discrepancy resolutions etc.
These​ ​conditions​ ​might​ ​cause​ ​significant​ ​fluctuation​ ​in​ ​Token​ ​pricing.

Smart​ ​contract​ ​limitations
Smart contract technology is still in its early stages of development, and its application is of
experimental nature. This may carry significant operational, technological, regulatory,
reputational and financial risks. Consequently, although the audit conducted by independent
third party increases the level of security, reliability, and accuracy, this audit cannot serve as
any form of warranty, including any expressed or implied warranty that the 1WO Smart
Contract is fit for purpose or that it contains no flaws, vulnerabilities or issues which could
cause​ ​technical​ ​problems​ ​or​ ​the​ ​complete​ ​loss​ ​of​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens.

Regulatory​ ​risks
The Blockchain technology, including but not limited to the issue of tokens, may be a new
concept in some jurisdictions, which may then apply existing regulations or introduce new
regulations regarding Blockchain technology-based applications, and such regulations may
conflict with the current 1WO Smart Contract setup. This may result in substantial
modifications of the 1WO Smart Contract, including but not limited to its termination and the
loss​ ​of​ ​1WO​ ​Tokens.

49

Price​ ​of​ ​Bitcoin​ ​and​ ​Ethereum
1World offers services to companies and individuals engaged in mining cryptocurrencies,
primarily Bitcoin. Such operations are highly dependent on Bitcoin prices at local exchanges.
Sharp and protracted decline in Bitcoin prices can affect the ability of 1World’s customers to
fulfill​ ​their​ ​contractual​ ​obligations​ ​to​ ​pay​ ​rental​ ​fees​ ​to​ ​token​ ​holders​ ​whose​ ​tokens​ ​they​ ​rent.

Rapid​ ​changes​ ​in​ ​technology​ ​may​ ​adversely​ ​affect​ ​mining​ ​business
Cryptocurrency mining is a very dynamic and fast-paced business. To remain competitive,
1World will use its best efforts to follow and promptly introduce the latest technologies at its
facility. However, 1World's failure to remain competitive despite its endeavors may pose the
risk of declining benefits for the 1WO Token holders. Likewise, token holders are advised to
monitor their own mining equipment performance and update it as needed. Alternatively, as
their equipment performance weakens over time, they should consider renting their tokens
out​ ​to​ ​other​ ​miners​ ​to​ ​avoid​ ​the​ ​decline​ ​in​ ​the​ ​mining​ ​rewards.

Fluctuation​ ​in​ ​token​ ​benefits
The 1WO Token is intended to provide a valuable benefit of access to 1World ecosystem for
cryptocurrency miners by giving them the ability to use tokens earning mechanism. Market
changes, a drop in engagement value for publishers and / or reduction of traditional online
display advertising may reduce the value of the 1WO Tokens and drive down the prices of
tokens.

Sales​ ​and​ ​other​ ​taxes
Token holders and purchasers of mining equipment may be required to pay sales tax
(collected at sale) and other taxes associated with the transactions contemplated herein,
whether in the United States or in their home countries. It will be a sole responsibility of the
token holders and purchasers of the mining equipment to comply with the tax laws of the
United​ ​States​ ​and​ ​other​ ​jurisdictions​ ​and​ ​pay​ ​all​ ​relevant​ ​taxes.

50

Force​ ​Majeure
1World’s performance may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force majeure
circumstances. For the purposes of this White Paper, force majeure shall mean extraordinary
events and circumstances which could not be prevented by 1World and shall include: acts of
nature, wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts,
slowdowns, prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or communication
service, acts of municipal, state or federal governmental agencies, other circumstances
beyond 1World's control, which were not in existence at the time of Token Launch. If such
circumstances occur prior to issuance of 1WO tokens and 1World is unable to issue 1WO
Tokens within 6 months from the projected date, the escrow agent may issue a refund at the
request of the 1WO Token purchasers. The refund will be issued in the original form of
payment​ ​at​ ​the​ ​exchange​ ​rate​ ​on​ ​the​ ​date​ ​of​ ​the​ ​refund.

Compliance​ ​with​ ​U.S.​ ​laws​ ​and​ ​regulations
Because the hosting facilities are located in the United States, 1WO Token holders who wish
to use their tokens to host their equipment at the facilities would be required to comply with
the U.S. laws and regulations and may need to verify their identities and provide proof of
address (for individuals), or verify their registration, good standing, list of ultimate beneficial
owners, and address (for legal entities) prior to using their 1WO Tokens and setting up their
equipment at 1World's facilities, or at any time thereafter upon 1World's request. Token
holders who fail to comply with such verification request, or who are determined to be
restricted from dealing with the U.S. entities or operating in the U.S., or who are otherwise
ineligible under the US law to host their equipment with 1World would be refused hosting or
1WO Token rental services, with no refund issued by 1World for the purchased tokens. Such
token holders may retain their tokens or may, at their discretion, choose to sell them to
eligible customers. Token purchasers are solely responsible for learning about the US laws
and legal restrictions applicable to residents of certain countries and individuals involved in
certain​ ​activities.

Disclosure​ ​of​ ​information
Personal information received from 1WO Token holders, 1WO Token renters, and owners of
the equipment submitted for hosting, the information about the number of tokens or miners
51

serviced by 1World, rewards earned on the pool, the wallet addresses used, and any other
relevant information may be disclosed to law enforcement, government officials, and other
third parties when 1World is required to disclose such information by law, subpoena, or court
order.​ ​1World​ ​shall​ ​at​ ​no​ ​time​ ​be​ ​held​ ​responsible​ ​for​ ​such​ ​information​ ​disclosure.

Value​ ​of​ ​1WO​ ​Token
Once purchased, the value of 1WO Tokens may significantly fluctuate due to various
reasons. 1World does not guarantee any specific value of the 1WO Token over any specific
period of time. 1World shall not be held responsible for any change in the value of 1WO
Token. Assumptions with respect to the foregoing involve, among other things, judgments
about the future economic, competitive and market conditions and business decisions, most
of which are beyond the control of the 1World project team and therefore difficult or
impossible to accurately predict. Although the 1World team believes that its assumptions
underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these may prove to be
inaccurate. As a result, the 1World team can offer no assurances that the forward-looking
statements contained in this White Paper will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant
uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements contained herein, the inclusion of
such information may not be interpreted as a warranty on the part of 1World or any other
entity​ ​that​ ​the​ ​objectives​ ​and​ ​plans​ ​of​ ​the​ ​1World​ ​project​ ​will​ ​be​ ​successfully​ ​achieved.

Other​ ​risks
Please note that the 1World project may be subject to other risks not foreseen by its
management​ ​at​ ​this​ ​time.
