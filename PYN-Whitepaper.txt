Questions and Answers (Q & A)
Why is Paycent dividing its Token Sale into 8 Phases?
We have been listening to our community and advisors and we want to improve the way ICO is normally done.
We believe that by breaking down our Token Sale into phases, token holders can track our progress from
Phase-to-Phase before contributing. This is also to provide accountability and show the progress of our
milestones we have set out to achieve for our community and token holders.
How is this different from holding the full amount in escrow?
We believe that by being transparent and allowing the public to track our accomplishments in each phase, we
will attract more like-minded token holders compared to just doing a one-time token sale.
What will be the benefit to current PYN Token Holders?
All PYN token holders will get preferential rights to participate in all upcoming phases, along with additional
bonuses that will be over-and-above to what is being offered via public sale.
How many phases are there?
There will be 8 phases over our company’s 4-year plan.
Is there a hard cap for each phase?
Yes, each phase will have a hard cap as stated in the addendum, and this will be inclusive of all bonus payouts
and existing token holders preferential rights to buy.
So are you are mining more tokens?
No, the total amount of PYN will be the same. The change is that we are offering the same in phases.
Why should I not Just wait and buy later?
Yes, you can, but you will miss out on the bonuses for PYN token holders and may also miss out on the
opportunity of appreciating PYN as the PYN sale is linked to the milestones and performance of Paycent.
What happens if Paycent does not reach its hard cap for each phase?
Being part of Texcent, Paycent remains self-funded by the founders till date. The founders have decided to
come in and cover the shortfall as and when needed. All unsold tokens for every phase will be destroyed,
ensuring that the token supply will always remain limited.

iv

At what price will the PYN be priced at every phase?
PYN will be sold at market value plus bonuses for all upcoming phases. Existing PYN token holders have
preferential rights (as stated in the addendum) and the bonus shall always be higher than the bonus for
public sale.
What is Preferential Right?
Preferential right is the option of first offer to current PYN token holder’s to participate in upcoming token sale
phases with a bonus prior to the sale being open to the public. This sale to current PYN token holders will be
open 48 hours prior to the public sale.

1. Abstract
Paycent is a global mobile dual e-wallet that can be funded by digital currencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin) with
high liquidity and fiat currencies within the same mobile application. This allows the digital currencies holders
multiple avenues of spend and straddle the world of fiat and digital currencies. By having integrated fiat and digital currency mobile wallets, plus the option of having a debit card linked to Paycent, this opens 200 countries and
36 million points that Paycent is accepted. The full ecosystem of Paycent and Paycent mPOS allows payments for
daily household spend such as utilities, cable and Telco airtime. All conversions from digital currencies to fiat will
be done in realtime.

2. Our USP’s and Competitive Advantage in the Market
Paycent, a digital currency wallet and an extension of our Paycent fiat wallet, will bridge the gap and create a
complete fiat and digital currency ecosystem. As Paycent is a live working product, we have an established network and a continuously expanding fiat ecosystem. We have secured regulatory licenses and are also currently
in partnership talks with several governments, banks, and companies to create an even larger ecosystem for
Paycent and Paycentos. We have already made successful strides in the application and we are fully committed
in improving the wallet. The development on several aspects are as follows:

2.1 Regulatory Licenses
We have obtained regulatory licenses in UAE and the Philippines, and in-principle approval in Singapore and
Hong Kong. With these licenses, we are able to start operations in the countries and build our user base.

2.2 Banks
We are currently in tier 2 talks to acquire and merge two banks in the Philippines, to create a larger ecosystem
for Paycent. Paycent will be functioning as the online channel for the merged bank, and provide
microfinancing and basic banking services for the unbanked. This strategy will allow us to set up more branches
across Asia and penetrate the mass market more quickly.

2.3 Exchange
We are in negotiation talks to develop and host our exchange – Paycent Realtime Exchange, in Dubai, with the
oversight of the Central Bank of UAE. This will provide realtime pricing and liquidity for Paycent and other
digital currencies. This will be a world first where a digital-exchange is built on a regulated exchange.

2.4 Payment infrastructure
We are in advanced talks with 2 major middle eastern economies to develop a Unified Digital Payments
Network for their banking and government services, and with Paycent as the online hosts of their national
payment infrastructure.

1

2.5 Established fiat ecosystem
Over a thousand merchants and counting are now accepting Paycent as an online payment mode. This has
been a team effort for the past year and our team is working continuously to expand this ecosystem.

2.6 Confirmed Digital assets ecosystem
We have signed an agreement with For Est Real Estate (forest.ae) in UAE to be the first digital asset wallet to
utilize Paycentos as a payment token, and are also in talks with over 30 real estate developers to accept Paycent as a payment mode.

3. Paycent background
Paycent is a development by Texcent Asia Pte Ltd. Singapore has been chosen as our company headquarters.
The rationale is that:
•
•
•

Singapore has a thriving FinTech culture
MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) is open to new FinTech ideas and incubation
South Asia has a huge population with a high mobile penetration that is open to mobile money with about
625 million people unbanked 1

4. Problem that we are solving
4.1 Bringing digital currency to the masses
One of the primary goals of Texcent is to bring the digital currency market/ecosystem to mainstream audiences.
Such audiences might have very little experience with digital currencies and will more likely have no easy
access to use and invest in digital currencies. Furthermore, there is the fear of new and innovative technologies
that needs to be overcome. In the Paycent app, the user swipes right to the Paycent e-wallet, allowing the user
to buy digital currencies, spend digital currencies and invest in digital currencies with a simple and seamless interface. The benefit to the Blockchain/digital currency ecosystem will be a huge influx of fiat market
capitalization into digital currency which will enlarge the ecosystem. Holders of digital currency will have a better
acceptance as digital currency become mainstream with seamless change through Paycent and its dual e-wallet.

Putting the World’s Money Into Perspective

4.2 ALLOWING digital CURRENCY USERS TO HAVE MULTIPLE
AVENUES OF SPEND
One of the current limiting factors of digital currencies is that, although the ecosystem is growing, there is a lack
of avenues of spending it in everyday life. With the Paycent app, a user can pay for his utilities and make
purchases with digital currency within the dual e-wallet. Because of our seamless integration, we have increased
the channels that digital currency can be used.

4.3 CONVERSION OF digitalCURRENCY TO FIAT AND
VICE VERSA IN Realtime
With the seamless integration between the dual e-wallets within Paycent, all digital currency conversion to fiat
will be done in realtime with a live exchange rate shown. This can eliminate fears and doubts of mainstream
audiences to venture into digital currency, because once digital currency is converted, it will be reflected in
their Paycent fiat e-wallet immediately.

3

4.4 CASHLESS FOR THE UNBANKED
With Paycent e-wallet app, the unbanked will have easy access to our merchant ecosystem and bill
payments with a simple iOS or Android app. This inclusion allows the masses to participate in digital world with
our network of clients and even a branded debit card that has over 200 million points including ATM
withdrawals. With Paycent, we are helping to push the unbanked to the forefront of currency freedom with the
ease of exchanging fiat money into digital currency with a singular app and vise versa to spend it on daily
essentials. The wallet allows financial inclusion to huge population that otherwise would be left behind in the
push to a cashless society.

4.5 Financing for the unbanked
Banks often do not offer non-collateralized loans unbanked individuals and new SME entrepreneurs.
An alternative solution to this is microloans or microfinancing. Using a proprietary Paycent approach, we
will assess individuals and provide loans to this group of people.
Using Big Data and through KYC processes, Paycent will gather demographic and financial information from the
customers. Additionally, Paycent will build a digital identity of a user’s credit rating and worthiness score which
will then be linked back to the user’s e-wallet profile. Some of the key scoring factors will include:
•
•
•
•

Digital identity and reputation
Social media history
Repayment history
Family identity verification

Initially, the loans offered to new users will be small, but as their reputation score improves, the amount limits
will be raised. The social media and family identity will make up some of the big data that we will be collecting
to verify the individuals.

5. the greAt token sAle
Implementing and integrating our digital Paycent e-wallet with our live Paycent fiat e-wallet demands special
resources. Bringing in the right set of personnel from Developers to Legal and developing the infrastructure will
require additional funds. We are offering an Initial Token Sale of PYN tokens (Paycentos), instead of raising funds
via the traditional method, to allow the community to participate in our success of straddling between the
digital asset and fiat world. The utility token can be used within the Paycent dual e-wallet whenever conversion
is required from digital currency to fiat.

5.1 What is the Offer

We will offer 60% of all PYN tokens created to the public for purchase on the 2nd November 2017 starting at 9am
Singapore time till 30th November 2017. A further 19% of the PYN tokens created will be kept by Texcent as a
reserve. Extra 1% bounty will be used for the bounty campaign. 10% of the tokens will be allocated for education
and research for related blockchain technologies in all verticals, and a part of this will also go towards funding
a Land Grant in Manila to construct the Asian Blockchain Institute of Technology (ABIT). ABIT’s vision is to bring
together the brightest minds in the community to build on the project. The remaining 10% of the PYN tokens
will be distributed to the founders, employees and early investors to secure long term interest and alignment
within the company.
Besides building the Asian Blockchain Institute of Technology (ABIT), we will also be funding academic research
and educational classes for aspiring developers, who will eventually make contributions and benefit the
blockchain community. With a large blockchain community forming in the Philippines and the region, ABIT will
also establish research cooperation with regional universities on various types and verticals of blockchain.
Classes on blockchain and its derivatives will be held for all interested student and developers, and blockchain
conferences will be organized to exchange ideas within the community and to bring awareness to the masses.

5

Each PYN token will be sold for 1:600 ETH (1 ETH will give your 600 PYN tokens). Other digital currencies will be
converted to ETH for the purchase. The minimum investment amount is 0.025 Ethereum.
We will accept a maximum of 450,000 ETH as our upper limit. If this amount is raise before the closing date
of our TOKEN SALE, we will stop the sale. If the amount is less than the maximum, the ratios will apply to the
amount raised.

5.2 THE REWARDS FOR PYN TOKEN HOLDERS
Holders of PYN tokens will receive 33% of the aggregate exchange rate profit for digital currencies to fiat and vice
versa converted between the dual e-wallet of Paycent. This will initially be done quarterly with the bounty being
paid in ETH to the PYN holders.
For the users of Paycent Debit Card, they will receive an addition 0.1% of each spend in PYN tokens as loyalties
token-back (similar to cash backs from credit cards). This will create a secondary distribution of PYN tokens that
will create an open market for PYN with a price support and price increase.
We will NOT create new PYN tokens after this TOKEN SALE, to support the growth of the PYN in the
open market.
Holders of PYN tokens will receive 33% of the total interest profit of micro loans to Paycent lenders. This will be
done quarterly with the bounty being paid in ETH to the PYN holders

6. Use Case Scenarios
Paycentos is the most convenient wallet up-to-date to buy/sell digital currency and spend it wherever you want
with the Paycent card. It lets users to top up the wallet with local currency via cash, cards, banks
transfer and then convert the fiat currency into equivalent Bitcoin or Ethereum in realtime.

1. Convert fiat currency to Bitcoin/Ethereum and vice versa in realtime
Tom received a couple of Bitcoins from a friend as a wedding present. He was sulking at what a wasted gift
he got until now. With Paycent, he converted the Bitcoins into his local fiat currency in realtime basis.

card. Even more, you can use the card at ANY ATM to withdraw local currency funds paying the
modest inter-currency exchange fee.

4. Filipino worker living in UAE
Jon lives in Dubai and his mother lives in the Philippines. Every month, Jon sends some of his savings to her. He
used to go with the conventional funds transfer companies such as MoneyGram and Western Union. Tired of
long queues and hefty convenience fees, he started to look for a reliable payment method which could do quick
transfers with low fees.
He stumbled upon Paycent, signed his mother for the Paycent Debit Card. She uses the card to pay at over
100,000 merchants and Sari-Sari stores in the Philippines. Also, she withdraws cash when needed from any local
ATM. Whenever the card is low on balance, Jon tops-up the card with fiat/digital currency.
Because the transfer happens on Blockchain, the transfer happens in realtime. Also, the transfer charges are
bare minimum. Jon does not worry anymore and lives happily.

5. Removing entry barriers to digital assets
Jia lives in Vietnam. She works hard and wants to save money for her family. Due to frequent fluctuations in her
national currency, she is always apprehensive of saving in Vietnamese Dong. The banks let her save in local
currency only. She has been looking for reliable alternate solutions.
Jia was able to register for Paycent application and do the e-KYC in less than 5 minutes. Amazed by the
possibilities of what the app can do for her apart from sending funds, she can store digital currencies in her
Paycent wallet and convert back into fiat in realtime basis.
Though she has never heard of the blockchain technology, the Paycent app gives her a comfortable spot to use
the technology. She feels that she has made a right choice.
A step into digital currency for the general masses.

• Acquiring Remittance and Wallet license, Overall Banking license and 2 banks in Philippines
45,000 ETH
This will allow Texcent to apply for a full banking license in the countries it is operating. Currently, Texcent is in
the process of applying for Money Licenses in HK, SG and MY. A full banking license will give Texcent the ability
to lower fees from interchange and transfer fees. Furthermore, Texcent will be in a better position to negotiate
local card rewards and royalties for local users. In the Philippines, we are in tier 2 talks to acquire two banks and
merge them, to allow Paycent to be their online presence, which can provide micro financing and basic banking
to the unbanked. As US is a large potential market for Texcent, it will require a substantial working capital to
acquire remittance and full banking licenses in all 50 states.

• User acquisition and marketing promotions
157,500 ETH
This will be used for marketing to the fiat world the benefits of digital currencies and the ease that Paycentos
allows a normal fiat user to enter into the digital currency world and its ability to convert back to fiat or pay for
everyday items in realtime. We will target GCC countries where there is a high proportion of wealth that is still
in the fiat ecosystem for ease of use of having a “Dual” e-wallet.

• Country operations and salesforce
90,000 ETH
As Paycent straddles both the digital currency and fiat world, offices are required and a salesforce for
partnerships and merchant acquisition. This ensures that Paycent will have a thriving ecosystem of merchants
and payment gateways for our users to pay with digital currency or fiat. We are targeting 9 countries with each
country using 10,000 ETHs for operation cost.
• Merchant acquisition and strategic partnerships
90,000 ETH
This will be used for strategic partnerships so that our Paycent users can have almost an immediate merchant
ecosystem that allows both the use and exchange of digital currencies in the domestic market. Furthermore
our salesforce will source for local “mom and pop” shops to entice them to use our Paycent mPOS which
accepts Paycentos digital currencies and Paycent fiat currency. This will allow the Paycent user to have a
market ecosystem in their neighborhood.

10

• Technical development and integration costs
67,500 ETH
Integration with Blockchain exchanges is highly technical and requires the resources of skilled engineers to build
and execute. The initial resource-intensive project will be to build an abstraction layer that allows future
exchanges to “plug and play” with our Paycent dual e-wallet framework. All other integration cost will be for our
e-wallets to be integrated into “brick and mortar” institutions such as utility companies, cable, schools and local
area governmental agencies. Retail and ecommerce sites will be integrated via regional/local aggregators.

8. Product information
“At Texcent, we aim to be the global leader in complete mobile and cashless transactions”

8.1 What is Paycent

integrated mobile applications. Paycent aims to be the global leader for complete mobile and cashless
transactions. Paycent runs on an entirely virtual channel and is comprised of two apps: one for users and one
for merchants. We offer both users and merchants a secure and convenient digital payment platform so you can
send and receive funds, shop and pay bills without using cash or credit cards.

11

8.2 What is Paycentos
Paycentos is a digital wallet that enables the user to exchange between fiat currencies and digital currencies
seamlessly. The Paycent e-wallet is the major gamechanger as it enables users to buy, store, transfer and pay
using blockchain assets through their smartphone or a physical Paycent Debit card across 200 countries and 36
million merchants.
Paycent aims and seeks to offer its users access to a plethora of blockchain assets and fiat currencies with
realtime accessibility and convenience, while adhering to the highest security standards in the industry.
Since the Paycent App is built on a decentralized platform, users and businesses can seamlessly exchange their
assets from one another. This eradicates the risks and frauds observed with centralized solutions in the market
currently.
The digital asset to fiat conversion takes place automatically at the time of transaction. The Paycent App itself
functions as an exchange where users can conveniently convert all types of blockchain assets into Paycentos
tokens and vice versa without any service fee incurred. Users can choose among the different digital assets for
any particular transaction or purchase from the Paycent App.

Product Advantages
• Multi-asset (any blockchain asset compatible with and accepted by the Paycentos Wallet)
• Assets stay in digital currency in Paycentos Wallet
• Best available foreign exchange and transaction fees
• Decentralized and trusted storage
• Global access to 36 million points of acceptance online and offline in close to 200 countries

Users earn a 0.1% reward for every purchase transaction. This incentive will be transferred to the user in form of
PYN tokens on a monthly basis, which additionally gives them the opportunity to become PYN token holders and
further benefit from a potential value upside of the tokens (see the section below entitled “Paycent Initial Token
Sale” for further details). Going forward, Paycent aims to distribute the reward in realtime.
12

8.3 What is Paycent mPOS
Paycent mPOS allows merchants to have the freedom of accepting digital currencies from our users with
Paycent digital wallet or any other private digital asset wallet. This gives merchants the option of keeping it in
digital asset or converting to fiat in realtime. The regular card MDR can be saved by the merchant if they transact
within the digital currency ecosystem, this is an added margin for merchants that want to go cashless but are
constrained to low margins and high MDRs that card companies / banks are charging.

mPOS – Extended version:
In order to scale the acceptance of digital currencies for all merchants in all categories. We are creating a
Paycentos digital asset gateway to function as a plug and play to their existing POS systems adding a benefit for
merchants to collect payments for VISA, MC, AMEX, JCB, Union Pay and digital currencies. Tailored customization
will be available for Corporates in the Retail, Hotel and Travel industries. The mPOS will be available on Web and
Android/iOS. Merchants using our gateway/mPOS will be listed on our Category Merchant list on our
Platform. Additionally, merchants can promote their products and services to thousands of digital currency users
across the globe.
Our in-house Exchange is a valuable element for offering competitive exchange rates to USD, EUR, GBP, SGD and
more to our Paycent merchant platform. We offer the lowest rates available for FIAT currencies to
digital currencies. The input currency list in our system covers: EUR, USD, GBP, SGD, MYR, Won, and many to
come.
Onboarding of Merchants take no longer than 24 hours. Technical bandwidth for merchants to integrate the
gateway takes 1-2 hours and there’s total technical support provided during the development phase.
Benefits to Merchants are that they no longer incur hefty MDRs and have global visibility for their brands and
promotions.

Wallet which can further be transferred to Paycent Wallet. Now the fiat is available to convert into a digital
asset. Digital asset is then powered by a Debit card enabling the facility for Online and Offline

10. Buyback and Rebates Programme
10.1 With our mPOS MDR 1.1%
(a) Non Paycentos digital curreny
•

1% is paid to Paycent for operational charge.

•

0.1% is used to buyback Paycentos directly from the market quarterly and then will be immediately burned.
This will be done for the 1st five years of the merchant using our mPOS, after that the merchant will be
charged only 1% MDR and the merchant will not be part of our buyback programme. As we will be
expanding our merchant ecosystem, we will have an ever-increasing number of merchants
contributing to our buyback programme.

(b) Paycentos digital curreny
•

0.1% is paid to Paycent for operational charge.

•

1% is given back to the user in the form of “token back” and is deposited into the Paycentos e-wallet
quarterly. This is to encourage our Paycent e-wallet user to switch to Paycentos as a default
digital currency thereby increasing its demand.

10.2 With our mPOS MDR 1.5%
•

1% is paid to Paycent for operational charge.

•

0.5% is used to buyback Paycentos directly from the market quarterly and then will be immediately burned.

•

With this buyback and burn with a finite supply of Paycentos, we are hoping to make Paycentos a compelling
opportunity to hold with a diminishing supply and high potential for the price to rise.

•

We have signed an agreement with Forest.ae to be their sole digital currency e-wallet to collect rental fees
in Paycentos from their rental property across GCC. We have negotiated a special MDR rate for the 1st five
years.
