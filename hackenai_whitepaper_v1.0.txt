Hacken Business to Business (B2B) products

1.2.1 Hackenproof
https://hackenproof.com
HACKENPROOF is a bug bounty platform that helps businesses protect their digital assets, the
personal data of customers, and their reputation through crowdsourced security.
By combining a “crowd” of cybersecurity researchers (white hat hackers) with the HackenProof
platform, we deliver services that traditional cybersecurity ﬁrms cannot. Conventional cybersecurity companies are constrained by the size of their teams, as the amount of time and skill available is limited. A bug bounty platform solves this issue since hundreds of security researchers
test products on a continuous basis. This approach allows vulnerabilities to be identiﬁed more
efﬁciently and thus prevent possible cyber threats.
The HackenProof platform brings together a large number of expert white hat hackers from all
over the world, specializing in ﬁnding vulnerabilities in various technologies such as web, mobile,
hardware/IoT, and especially in Blockchain applications and smart contracts.
The core of the HackenProof platform is ethical cooperation between cybersecurity professionals
and responsible IT companies that care about the security of their products. We ensure responsible and coordinated vulnerability disclosure and encourage white hat hackers to protect modern
businesses.

Bug Bounty Platform Advantages
1. Unlike conventional cybersecurity ﬁrms, the bug bounty platform attracts a crowd of highly
skilled cybersecurity researchers with various backgrounds to ﬁnd product vulnerabilities.
2. The bug bounty platform provides transparent reporting, 24/7 analytics, and information
on the current status of your bug bounty program.
3. The platform handles all operational issues - validating submitted bugs, communicating
with the white hat hackers, and organizing other operational activities.

Due to the responsible decision to run a bug bounty at Hackenproof, white hat hackers identiﬁed
high and critical vulnerabilities before the black hat did at more than 40 products. Tech teams
were able to timely ﬁx them and companies didn’t experience any ﬁnancial losses.

1.2.2 Security Assessment & Incident Response
https://hacken.io/services/#security-assessment
Hacken delivers a wide range of professional services to protect systems, networks, and software
applications from cyber attacks and human-based errors for businesses operating in the digital
world. Our inhouse specialists design the best-in-class solutions, focusing on the speciﬁc needs of
the client.

1.2.3 Blockchain Security Consulting
https://hacken.io/services/#blockchain-security
From 2017-2019, Hacken performed 150+ security audits for blockchain companies, establishing it as a trusted partner and industry leader. Hacken also manages blockchain security industry
players cooperation through various public and private cybersecurity groups and communities.
Our professional team of consultants performs smart contract audits, DApp security reviews, and
blockchain protocol reviews in accordance with our internal methodology and industry best practices. Hacken provides security consulting services across multiple different blockchain protocols, including VeChainThor, Ethereum, Tron, EOS, and more.
Smart Contract Audit
The Hacken team analyzes smart contract functionality and administers necessary checks
against all known vulnerabilities. A security audit includes a manual codebase audit by Hacken
consultants, an automated tools security audit, and a brief analysis of the smart contracts functionality.
DApp Security Review
A decentralized application (DApp) operates its backend code on a decentralized peer-to-peer
network.

4

A Hacken DApp security review focuses on the client and server-side security issues for the DApp.
The review also consists of a smart contract audit for the back-end and "smart" penetration
testing (“pentest”) for the front-end. A smart pentest checks for any potential server misconﬁgurations and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). For DApps with rich server logic (database, registration
forms etc.), a full pentest is recommended.
Blockchain Protocol Security
Cybersecurity is often not a priority during the development of innovative and original protocols.
However, after accumulating considerable sums of money, blockchain protocols are susceptible
to becoming targets of hacking attacks. Hacken offers blockchain protocol security which
includes three sub-services: a protocol model security review, a tokenomics review, and a protocol implementation security analysis.

1.2.4 CryptoExchange Ranks - CER
https://cer.live
CER is the ﬁrst digital assets auditor that systematizes and publishes data on crypto exchanges to
protect traders from fraudsters.
CER has worked on numerous transparency researches and investigations that have impacted
the industry maturity. They were republished by most of the biggest tech and crypto media.
CER is widely known for its trusted rankings:
•
•

Top 100 cryptocurrency exchange cybersecurity ranking
Cryptocurrency exchange hot and cold wallets balance ranking

CERtified
Hacken helps cryptocurrency exchanges build long-term successful relationships with their
customers by setting up the highest cybersecurity standards through the CERtiﬁcation compliance process.
Cybersecurity CERtificate
While blockchain technology facilitated freedom in executing ﬁnancial operations, it also attracted thousands of black hat hackers. The main threat is the irreversibility of hacked or misspent
crypto assets. Once an exchange is hacked, it is extremely unlikely that any compromised digital
assets can be reversed, as most blockchains are immutable. Users of the exchanges have the
right to know if the platform is compliant with cybersecurity best practices.
As a cybersecurity leader, Hacken has created industry-leading cybersecurity standards for cryptocurrency exchanges. The CER cybersecurity certiﬁcate is an Exchange 2.0 compliance standard, which signiﬁes that a cryptocurrency exchange can be trusted.
Cryptoexchange security assessment methodology was developed based on vast experience.

Certiﬁcation covers areas such as the building and maintenance of a secure network, protection
of clients data as well as provides effective cybersecurity threat protection measures.

5

Proof of Funds CERtificate
Trade volume has already been deemed an unreliable metric for cryptocurrency exchange’s ranking. Traders and Crypto projects are no longer using the trade volume metric while making
decisions on which exchange to choose.
Today the key metric for a trader is transparency of operations and mitigation insolvency risks for
exchange.
The ﬁrst step for industry maturity is to develop an accountability standard for exchanges to
report the balances of crypto that they are holding on their traders' behalf.
Proof of funds CERtiﬁcate is the ﬁrst and leading initiative for hot and cold wallet’s data
aggregation.

1.2.5 Cyber School & White Hat community development
https://cyberschool.tech
Cyber School is a training course for juniors/rookies to become middle-level cybersecurity
specialists.
We transferred our experience from running a number of offline hacking events to create a cybersecurity training program, the most comprehensive one available in Eastern Europe. It runs for
ﬁve months and includes:
•
•
•

High-level understanding of TCP/IP protocol and OSI Seven Layer Model
Windows and/or Unix-based systems/architectures and related security,
LAN/WAN technologies
Solid understanding of information technology and information security

White Hat Hackers Community Development
In 2017 and 2018, Hacken organized a global cybersecurity forum HackIT that gathers leading
companies and prominent names from the industry, as well as top ethical hackers.
In 2019, Hacken co-hosted Blockshow Asia 2019 in Singapore as a privacy and cybersecurity
partner. BlockShow one of the biggest conferences in the blockchain industry, considered by
many as a “flagship event”.
From 2019 and onwards, Hacken is supporting various cybersecurity conferences and white hat
community events with an essential focus on the Onsight Bug Bounty Marathon Hacken Cup.
About Hacken Cup
The Hacken Cup is a short timeframe bug bounty event custom-tailored to a client's needs.
Hacken brings together top white hat hackers to perform an onsite bug bounty marathon for
select clients. White hat hackers from all over the world look for vulnerabilities, immediately
reporting their ﬁndings on the spot. Triage teams validate reports allowing the security team is
able to tackle found issues right away.

2. What is HackenAI
The creation of HackenAI is our reward and effort to pay back the Hacken community for their
trust and support. All gained experienced, partnerships, expertise in cybersecurity, and tokenomics are now in one single application. We believe it will disrupt the personal cybersecurity market.

2.1 Problem
cybercare = healthcare

Preventative measures go along way in healthcare and cybersecurity.
However, many individuals don’t invest in preventative measures to improve their health or their
cybersecurity protocols. Typically, we only visit doctors when there’s a problem or seek professional IT help after an attack.
Healthcare and cyber protection require a preventive approach. But many still disregard their
personal cybersecurity because:
•
•
•
•
•

They believe that cybersecurity is too complicated and don’t want to spend time it out
There is a misconception that antivirus software solve all problems
There is a lack of educational material regarding personal cybersecurity
Most people think that they are safe just because they are small targets, that is why they
are the perfect victims
Lack of sense of urgency because they haven’t been hacked yet or don’t personally know
any hacking victims

Rise of digital assets
For many years, banks and governments have been responsible for the security of assets. As
blockchain technology adoption grows and systems become more decentralized, users must
take personal control over their data. Software alone does not provide a sufﬁcient level of cybersecurity, and security ignorance is no longer an option. The risk of a cybersecurity attack on an
individual user who is their own crypto asset custodian is increasingly higher due to the irreversibility of hacked or misspent crypto assets.
Digital assets are now getting a lot of attention, as the transition into a more digital reality begins.
However, even since the early days of the internet, it was almost impossible to prevent digital
fraud and other criminal activity. With the introduction of blockchain technology, some strides
forward have been made, however, we still have to deal with the huge problem of securing all of
our digital assets.
In the world of cryptocurrencies, the main threat is the irreversibility of hacked or misspent crypto
assets. Once an exchange is hacked, it is extremely unlikely that any compromised digital assets
can be recovered, as most blockchains are immutable.
Today, individuals’ digital assets are the easiest targets for black hat hackers. As a result, we see:
•
•
•
•

Social media phishing attacks as the main gateway to crypto account access
The takeover of individual accounts through leaked databases and 2FA resets
Increase in successful SIM swap attacks
Bitcoin clipboard steals
9

Cyber threats as a stoppage factor for crypto mass adoption
While cryptocurrencies will inevitably become a standard asset class, there will be a delay in
adoption as hacks and security threats continue to dominate the headlines of the mainstream
media. According to the Deloitte 2019 Global Blockchain Survey, 29% of enterprise-level
respondents see security threats as major organizational barriers to institutional blockchain tech
investors, along with regulatory issues at 30%, and legacy system retroﬁtting/replacement also
at 30%.

2.2 Market Opportunity
Just like antiviruses software has helped to protect almost every computer since the ’90s, users
in the new digital era need cybersecurity assistance to form a preventive shield from new and
growing cybersecurity threats. With all of these threats constantly on the minds of both current
investors and sideline investors, there is an increased demand for products that put these fears
to rest. More speciﬁcally, there is a need for:
•

Cyber-Hygiene Education - Interactive online training for both non-tech professionals
and tech staff to hone their cybersecurity skills. This can include the basics such as
rotating your password once in a while, not clicking on suspicious-looking emails, and
other simple practices that can increase security. Armed with this knowledge, people will
be better prepared to manage anything hackers throw against them.

•

Preventing Breaches and Intrusions - This will include tips companies implement to
better safeguard against hacks. Defending against SQL injections, authentication
bypasses, IDORs, local ﬁle inclusions, and so many other threats is critical. In fact, there
are countless threats out there that are unknown to most

•

Cyber Security Incident Response - By the time you realize that you’ve been hacked, it's
already too late. Furthermore, you need to know which actions to take if in the event of a
hack or suspicious activity surrounding your accounts. Thus, people must know about all
cyber breaches as soon as possible to safeguard their assets and protect their personal
information.

At Hacken, we believe that for a personal cybersecurity application to get mass adopted, it has to
solve cybersecurity issues in the most simple and convenient manner:
•
•
•
•

Simple starting pack with a quick practical knowledge win
Focus on UI/UX. Simplicity and embedded gamiﬁcation throughout the user journey
Multifunctionality. All needed cybersecurity tools in one “swiss army application”
Proof of virality. The app should have been easy to peach to a friend with and without
ﬁnancial incentives

2.3 HackenAI Solution
Right now, everybody is looking for a solution that will provide them with some peace of mind
without having any expert cybersecurity knowledge. Fortunately, there is a product that does
exactly this: HackenAI.

10

HackenAI is a revolutionary, 360° cybersecurity companion product that incentivizes users to
learn good cybersecurity habits. Powered by the native HAI token, HackenAI takes ownership of
user cybersecurity by consistently watching all potential threats and malpractices, and immediately prompts users with timely, detailed information. It even suggests steps to take in mitigating
the risks of exploitation.
For early adopters and users who were not involved in any cybersecurity activities, they start with
a dashboard of practical educational modules they’ll need to complete in order to achieve a
99.9% level of protection against known cybersecurity threats. HackenAI will drive users through
notiﬁcations and clear guidance and will keep a positive track for everyday practical knowledge
wins.

2.3.1 Cyber Boot Camp
CyberBootCamp is a user’s personal guide in the world of cybersecurity. With our constantly
updated educational material, the user will learn the basics of personal cybersecurity in a simple
and gamiﬁed way. At the time of the ﬁrst release, the HackenAI CyberBootCamp will consist of six
modules. Each module consists of the theoretical lessons, the practice, and the ﬁnal test.
After successfully passing the CyberBootCamp, users will be rewarded with HAI tokens in equivalent to a one month subscription fee for the HackenAI app. After completing the BootCamp, the
user will receive additional tradeable HAI tokens and cybersecurity expert status.

The CyberBootCamp will consist of:
module 1

Accounts Management. In this module, users will learn how to create a strong
password, what passwords they should avoid, and how to minimize risks of
being hacked using weak passwords. Also, users will check their accounts for
compromised data leakages and learn how to use 2FA-authentication in the
safest way. After passing this module, the user will gain access to and learn
how to efﬁciently set up the HackenAI password manager and will be allowed
to subscribe to a dark web monitoring service.

module 2

Anti-phishing. Users will learn what websites to avoid in order not to be caught
by phishers. Useful life hacks on how to recognise phishing sites will be
presented in this Boot Camp. As a part of a social engineering test, users will
receive actual phishing exploits to his or her linked emails without any warnings. This module is one of the most important for users because phishing
attacks are becoming more common and in most cases it’s quite difﬁcult to
distinguish phishing services.

module 3

Privacy. During the third module, users will gain crucial knowledge about
important privacy settings of his or her social media accounts and hardware
devices. Users will learn how to determine whether an application that collects
data might be compromised, what permission(s) they should deny while
installing new applications, and how to set up the privacy settings to keep the
personal data secured.

11

module 4

Data Protection Rules. In this module, users will learn basic principles about
how to protect his or her personal data on the internet. It includes best practices for how to store data securely, basic encryption methods, and critical backups.

module 5

Digital Assets Security. This module was created in collaboration with white hat
hackers and will be extremely useful for digital asset users. We have consolidated all trusted knowledge about secure storing of private keys, secure
trading practices, cryptocurrency exchanges API policies, operating software
crypto wallets, hardware wallet usage, and much more.

module 6

Essentials. In the last module, users will learn how to use global DNS, when it’s
necessary to use a VPN, what antivirus software to trust, and essential information about available cybersecurity tools.

2.3.2 Password Manager
Massive phishing scams, data breaches, and identity theft are often in the headlines, and
people are understandably worried. It’s not just government employees who are vulnerable, but
all of us. For example, 64% of Americans have personally experienced a major data breach. Yet
this is a global problem. In 2018, there were four billion internet users, and cybercrime cost the
world $3 trillion. By 2021, there will be six billion Internet users, and the cost of cybercrime is
expected to rise to $6 trillion per year. One of the biggest problems is password storage. A
signiﬁcant amount of cybercrimes were committed via password theft. Most of the users don't
pay much attention to the security of their passwords because of:
•
•
•

Lack of understanding of the risks and consequences of being hacked
Pre-existing safety nets in legacy systems
Little Knowledge of best cybersecurity practices

As a result, people are starting to care about their cybersecurity too late, in most cases only after
being hacked. HackenAI Password Manager can help. The main purpose of the HackenAI
Password Manager is the secure storage of a user’s passwords and other critical personal data.
By passing the Boot Camp, users learns how to set up the password manager correctly and use it
on a daily basis.
All users’ data is kept only on their hardware devices. In one click, users can backup passwords
using cutting-edge encryption and store it in HackenAI secure storage and/or on the VeChainThor
blockchain. If the user needs to sync it with another device or restore it on a lost smartphone, the
user can do it by decrypting the last sync, which is stored secure storage or VeChainThor
blockchain by entering seed phrase (12 words) and passing additional authentication layers. To
protect against sim swap attacks, the Password Manager will not make use of phone numbers for
authentication. For quick access to data in an application or on device, users use local passwords
(may be different on each device).

12

The basic functionality of the Password Manager will include:
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Primary functions
· Import Items (passwords) from external password storages
· Export Items to CSV
· Manually add items
· Copy username/password/OTP/url
· Open (launch website in new tab of the browser)
· Generating password (when form is ﬁling and in the separate menu)
· Automatic password capturing (when form sent)
· Password strength alerts (One password in multiply Items, worst passwords,
short passwords, bad passwords ﬁred in the internet, password monitoring)
· Forms autoﬁlling
Sharing Items with other people
Reporting about Items and storage health
Select identity for session
Encrypted storage for seed phrase printscreens
Private keys and proﬁles storage
Secure notes storage
Emergency contact

2.3.3 Two-factor authentication (OTP generation)
With HackenAI two-factor authentication, users can add their online accounts to the application
to generate one-time passwords. Similar to apps such as Google Authenticator, HackenAI has the
ability to backup data in secure storage. This is a must-have feature for users who care about their
personal cybersecurity.

2.3.4 Compromised accounts monitoring
Using HackenAI, continuous monitoring of accounts for compromises is possible. Usually it is
enough to search by email using the API of third-party services or third-party databases. On the
other hand, a separate service is responsible for this, which checks the passwords through the
databases of leaked data and gives the results to client application. Data is checked by the date
of compromise and the date of the last password change. If the date of the last password change
is unknown, then we consider the data compromised and notify the user about it.

2.3.5 Secure storage
Data secure storage is used to save user data, such as notes, screenshots, private keys, credit
card data, and so on. This data is stored as securely as passwords, and the user can share it without transmitting it in clear text format through insecure channels.

13

2.3.6 VPN service
A premium VPN service will be available for HackenAI paid subscribers. VPN secures the private
network, using encryption and other security mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users
can access it and that the data cannot be intercepted. This type of network is designed to provide
a secure, encrypted tunnel to transmit the data between the remote user and the company
network. It can also be leveraged for personal needs for securing network data. Hacken VPN
protects users from unwanted advertisements and snoopers that track you across the web.

2.3.7 NonCustodial Crypto Wallet
A non-custodial multi-network crypto wallet, that at launch, will support the following currencies:
Bitcoin, Ethereum, VeChainThor (VET), VIP-180 (VTHO, HAI), ERC-20, BEP-2. More blockchains
to be added later. The main purpose for the crypto wallet is a secure storage of the currencies and
making use of the staking options for HAI.

2.3.8 Digital Asset Viewer/Tracker
Most crypto users employ different exchanges for trading crypto. This is done because there is no
single exchange that trades all the tokens. There are several solutions for manual input of the
assets and a few that are building a one-stop trading terminal.
In our digital assets tracker, we don’t make any bidding or other actions through exchanges API.
We strongly recommend using read-only API credentials for adding to our application
Few of the most famouscyber attacks were committed using the “stupid trade” technique
through API. The Hacken team sees API’s as a backdoor window, and in most cases, the weakest
point of exchanges security.

Using the Digital Asset Tracker, you can:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Connect all exchanges accounts and import all assets data every time while login
Connect wallets and add them to the consolidate crypto statement
Track performance of their crypto assets
Monitor performance of their trading bots
View the average buy prices
See the trading proﬁtability chart
Export the consolidated statement
Add assets to the Watchlist
Conﬁgure custom triggers for alerts

2.3.9 Cybersec Marketplace
With HackenAI, users will beneﬁt from having access to third-party cybersecurity services and
products on a marketplace. The marketplace will include the ability to purchase anti-viruses,
cloud protection services, performance boosters, etc. Purchases on the marketplace will be done
in HAI.

14

2.3.10 CER
The Crypto exchanges ranking module is going to be integrated in HackenAI. Users will be able to
check up to date information about all crypto exchanges including their security and solvency.

2.3.11 News and industry alerts
The Hacken analytical center continuously releases cybersecurity research, crypto-fraud investigations, and white hat hacking insights. We inform users of any new data leakages and explain in
simple words what happened in a timely manner. In addition, we ensure that HackenAI users are
aware of unethical and fraudulent crypto companies.

2.3.12 Others
Additional features that will be developed in later HackenAI releases are:

1. PROXY SERVICE

(for Browser extensions)

2. DISABLING TRACKERS (for
3. SECURE BROWSER (for

Browser extensions)

mobile apps)

2.4 Tech Implementation
Hacken is a scope of client-server applications. Clients applications are available on:
•
•
•
•

Mobile applications for iOS and Android
Desktop applications for Windows and macOS
Web version
Extensions for most popular web-browsers.

All operations with user’s data are performed on client-side. The backend doesn't have any
access to decrypted user’s data or keys to decrypt data.
On the backend application level, HackenAI has a microservice architecture. The microservice
architecture allows for easy scaling and the ability to quickly add functionality.

By default, the user’s data is stored in secure data storage, but users can enable data storing on
the VechainThor blockchain. In blockchain, data is publicly available but not personalized and
encrypted. The advantage of saving data on the blockchain is that it is immutable and is always
available with internet access.

2.5 Security
The most important part of technical implementation is data security. HackenAI uses the latest
and best data protection practices. All critical data is well protected.

Protecting user data
All data is protected with at least three security keys:
•

User Seed phrase
· Generated by application
· Never stored on HackenAI servers
· Used Only to generate private keys for deciphering sync data and crypto-assets access
· Never transfers over the internet

•

Local password
· Set up by the user
· Used for access to data on authorized devices
· Never stored on HackenAI servers.
· Never transfers over the internet

•

User device key
· Auto-generated for each device
· Used for authentication

Local access to data
Access to local data requires a local password, which is only known by the user. Local password
can be different for various devices with the same account. It is used to generate the AES 256-bit
key for ciphering and deciphering keys (global) to decrypt user data. 256-bit key generation is
done with the following inputs: local password, generated 32-byte salt (cryptography), and
randomly chosen 16-byte initialization vector.

Server data protection
On the server-side, HackenAI cyphers all user data when storing it. This encryption is done on the
user device, and we don’t have any keys for deciphering data. Only the user with private keys can
decrypt all data.

Communication security
Communication between clients and servers are secured with SSL/TLS. All data transmitted by
the internet is already encrypted on the user's device.
Communication between browser or browser extension and HackenAI application is secured by
AES256.
For authentication, HackenAI uses zero-knowledge solution.
Data sharing
Users can share their data with other users. HackenAI even in the data sharing process doesn’t
have access to raw data.
For data sharing purposes, HackenAI uses asymmetric encryption. When user account registered
application creates a unique pair of public and private keys. The private key stored in the user’s
personal data storage. The public key sends to HackenAI servers.
When users want to share data:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

user1 asks user2’s public key
user1 generates a unique key for sharing data (sharing object key)
user1 encrypts sharing object key by user2’s public key
user1 sends encrypted sharing object key to HackenAI servers
user1 encrypts data (password, note, or more) with sharing object key
user1 sends encrypted data to HackenAI servers
user2 receives notiﬁcation about data sharing from user2
user2 manually accepts data sharing in application
user2 receives encrypted object key and encrypted data
user2 decrypts object key by own private key and then decrypts by object key sharing
data

18

Account recovery
For account recovery or adding a new device, the user simply needs to enter their recovery seed
phrase, generated on registration. When the seed phrase is inputted, it transforms into the primary 256-bit key. This key is used to derive keys for deciphering data is downloaded from HackenAI
storage.
Account recovery by guardians
HackenAI offers a recovery mechanism by guardians (people you trust). Guardians must be registered in HackenAI. If a user wants to share their private key with his or her trustees, he can specify the guardian’s user emails. All potential guardians must approve the user’s request. If a potential guardian is not registered in HackenAI yet, they can register then approve the request. The
user chooses the number of guardians and minimum required number of guardian responses
with key parts. After all guardians approve the requests, the user’s client sends parts of their
private key to the trustees' client.
If the user loses their seed phrase and local password (or loses their device), they can make a
request to recoverer the keys through their guardians. When a minimum required number of
guardians responds to the request, the user gets access to his account.
Bug bounty
The private bug bounty program with top white hat hackers will run for all unpublished HackenAI
releases.
After each application update release, we will announce public bug bounties with extensively
higher than market remunerations.
We will open source most critical parts of our source code to ensure the highest security standards.

2.7 Competitors Analysis
Prior to HackenAI, there was NO crypto-speciﬁc cybersecurity protection and prevention
software on the market for individual use. The following companies offer a fraction of our app’s
functionality.

20

Our main competitors are:

LASTPASS —

a freemium password manager that stores encrypted passwords online.
A user's content in LastPass, including passwords and secure notes, is protected by
one master password. The content is synchronized to any device in which LastPass software or app extensions are used. Information is encrypted with AES-256 encryption with
PBKDF2 SHA-256, salted hashes, and the ability to increase password iterations value.
Encryption and decryption take place at the device level.
The most known incident with LastPass occurred in 2015. It was a breach of user data,
include user emails, password hashes, server per user salts and authentication hashes.
Other incidents (2016, March 20, 2017, March 25, 2017 and 2019) concerned browser
extensions vulnerabilities on the client-side. It could lead to a leak of user credentials.

1PASSWORD — a password manager developed by AgileBits Inc. It provides a place
for users to store various passwords, software licenses, and other sensitive information in a virtual vault that is locked with a PBKDF2-guarded master password. By
default, this encrypted vault is stored on the company's servers for a monthly fee.
DASHLANE — a cross-platform premium password manager and digital wallet application available on macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android. Dashlane uses a Freemium pricing
model, which includes both a free tier and a premium subscription. Over time, more
features were introduced to the product such as: multi-factor authentication, automatic form filling, password generating, digital wallet, security breach alert, and
VPN.
KEEPASS — a free and open-source password manager. KeePass supports a number of
plugins. It has a password generator and synchronization functionality, supports
two-factor authentication, and has a Secure Desktop mode. It can use a two-channel
auto-type obfuscation feature to offer additional protection against keyloggers.
KeePass can import from over 30 other most commonly used password managers.

2.8 Go-to-market strategy
Priority markets
The market potential for personal cybersecurity is vastly untapped. The ﬁrst priority market for
HackenAI is the VeChain community with 60,000 current VET holders. The second priority
market will be сrypto users who do not use password managers. They are low-hanging fruit for
black hat hackers, that’s why we intend to reach them before the bad actors do. The next priority
market will be primarily, the English-speaking userbase who are aware of the burgeoning crypto
space but are afraid to enter due to cybersecurity risks.

The password manager market has more than 60 million users, offering a wide range of opportunities for user acquisition campaigns in the existing market. We believe that the combination
of both existing password manager’s market and emerging the VeChain and crypto market will
be a driving force of HackenAI’s go-to-market strategy.
Daily usage
HackenAI has the probability to be used daily for cybersecurity and digital assets tracking
purposes, password management, dark web monitoring, and other features. Personal cybersecurity will become a new trend of the cyber era, and we believe HackenAI will take the lead in this
market.
22

3. What is HAI
HAI is a VIP180 token, minted on the VeChainThor Blockchain.
HAI will be used as a utility token to power most activities performed within the HackenAI
Platform. Holders of HAI will receive beneﬁts from both HackenAI Platform, as well as our white
hat community and B2B business activity.

3.1 Why VeChain?
For the past year, our team has evaluated migration options to all major blockchain platforms. We
have reviewed the VeChainThor blockchain, and without a doubt, it is the best available option for
us in the blockchain market for the following reasons:

•
SECURITY. Hacken was a security auditor of the VeChainThor blockchain
protocol. VeChainThor’s Proof of Authority consensus is one of the most secure methods to protect its users from currently known hacker attacks.
•
TECHNOLOGY. Unlike any other blockchain, VeChainThor’s Multi-Party
Payment (MPP) and Multi-Task Transaction (MTT) bring greater accessibility and will be important enablers of mass adoption. MPP is incredibly important for a
smooth user experience, key for mass user adoption of blockchain technology. MPP
allows for HackenAI to sponsor ausers’ transactions, making it more user-friendly for an
audience that may not be blockchain-savvy enough to calculate the amount of gas they
need in their wallet.
•
ENTERPRISE ADOPTION. DNV GL, PWC, Deloitte, and many other corporations are actively working together with VeChain in pursuit of blockchain mass adoption.
Hacken shares a similar enterprise client strategy. We understand that it takes a lot of
professionalism and trustworthiness for enterprises of that caliber to lend their name.
•
VALUES AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLES. It’s no secret that most of the Hacken
and VeChain core team have professional experience with Deloitte and PwC. We share
the same values and ethical principles, allowing us to collaborate effectively.
•
VECHAIN ECOSYSTEM. VeChain has an active community of projects built on
the VeChainThor blockchain, like OceanEx, 8Hours, Plair, Safe Haven, and more.

3.2 HAI transaction model
As HAI is a VIP180 token on VeChainThor, transaction fees on the VeChainThor blockchain must
be paid using VTHO in accordance to the VeChainThor transactional model. On the user-level,
VTHO is generated by holding VET or can be purchased at open market. However, HackenAI will
implement MPP to mitigate the need for users to hold VTHO to access our services by sponsoring
their transaction fees. This will increase the rate of adoption.
23

Payments for services
For user convenience, we have designed HackenAI to operate on a single token model (HAI
token). We will implement transaction fee payment delegating for HackenAI services.
When the user wants to pay for services, or make staking, he or she makes payment in HAI, and
Hacken pays transaction fee for this payment.
For these purposes, Hacken makes Smart Contract, and then use VIP-191 protocol or MPP with
MTT.

For sending HAI from one user to another, the company needs to use VIP-191 protocol. When the
user sends a transaction, he or she pays the transaction fee in HAI to Hacken, and Hacken pays it
in VTHO to the blockchain. Users should not think about VTHO to pay for GAS. The user works
with only one token.

24

According to our cooperation agreement, the Vechain Foundation contributes to Hacken ecosystem development 20% from monthly total VTHO received from HAI transactions sent from HackenAI wallet. This contribution is proportionally distributed between HAI fourth level staking
partners.
The number of HAI valuable transactions within VechainThor Blockchain will grow in line with the
HackenAI user base.

3.3 Tokenomics
HackenAI’s mission is to improve individual’s cybersecurity knowledge through education, a
variety of tools gathered in one app, and incentiﬁcation. HackenAI is free to install and to use the
ﬁrst six months after the successful completion of all CyberBootCamp modules.
Revenue model
For the purpose of sustainable HackenAI development and HAI demand growth, we will require
monthly subscription payments for all HackenAI modules activation. Subscription fees will be
introduced at HackenAI Beta release. At Beta release, subscription fees will be paid in HAI only
and is variable depending on HAI market price. Users are charged with an advanced monthly
payment every ﬁrst day of the month. VTHO costs for transaction are included in the monthly
subscription fee.
Later HackenAI releases will introduce an embedded decentralized exchange module, which will
allow users to pay ﬁat and other cryptocurrencies for the HackenAI subscription fee. Paid funds
are used to automatically buy the required amount of HAI and send them to the Hacken corporate account to complete the subscription payment cycle.

If HAI’s price appreciates during the staking period, the user can re-apply to the same staking
level at a new increased HAI price at the end of the staking period. Released differences can be
immediately traded.
If HAI’s price depreciates during the staking period, users can re-apply to the same staking
level with no additional collateral needed.
HAI Staker program rules can be changed after reaching 100,000 subscribers milestone.
Tokenomics was designed in tight cooperation with Economics Design.

Referral bonus program
To accelerate the rate of adoption, we will introduce a referral bonus program for all of our
users. Pitching HackenAI is easy, since it solves everyone’s real-life problems.
Each user can earn HAI through referrals. HAI equivalent of a one month subscription is paid to
regular HackenAI users for each referred graduate of the CyberBootCamp.
The higher the user staking level, the bigger the remuneration for the same referral job. Below
is an illustration of six month referral earnings to different staking levels:

•
•
•
•
•

HackenAI modules development
Regional expansion
Community building
Cryptocurrency exchanges listing
Partnerships

3.4 HAI as a key element for HackenAI user base
growth
HackenAI is fully powered by HAI token that is an essential part of the application. When the App
is installed, the user experience starts with an educational CyberBootCamp. Users receive their
ﬁrst HAI tokens as a reward for successful completion of BootCamp modules. If all tests are
passed the user will get enough tokens to use all HackenAI functions six months for free. For
most of HackenAI users, HAI token will be their ﬁrst digital asset.
A key success factor of every application’s initial launch is word of mouth. Every Hacken community member knows that demand for HAI will grow if they tell their friends about it and its beneﬁts
HackenAI. The core team has created an effective elevator pitch that our initial community can
leverage in spreading the word:

"Hey, check your email in
HackenAI’s leaks database
compromised passwords!"

for

"Hey, check your microphone settings and find out what apps are
listening to us now!"
"Hey, as a reward for becoming
more secure, you could earn HAI
tokens!”

The Early Adopter Advocacy and Referral Marketing Strategy will give
users the ability to pitch the app to their friends and be rewarded with
additional HAI. When the App is installed, and CyberBootCamp is
successfully passed, both users will receive a reward in the form of HAI
tokens that they will be able to use to cover subscription fees as well as
purchasing any of HackenAI’s products. The inner wallet will allow the
transfer of HAI token between and the ability to use it as a form of
payment.

28

3.5 HKN Migration
Hacken Ecosystem ERC20 token HKN will migrate from the Ethereum Blockchain to the
VeChainThor blockchain. During this process, the current HKN tokens will be converted to HAI
tokens minted on the VeChainThor Blockchain as a VIP180 token.

After much deliberation and analysis with internal and external partners, the token swap ratio for
our HKN holders is ﬁnalized as 1:15 (1 ERC20 HKN token = 15 VIP180 HAI tokens).
The swap ratio was determined based on a combination of several factors,
taking into consideration the best interests of the community.
The HKN to HAI token swap is planned for early 2020, which will also depend on several moving
factors such as the private token presale, limited sale to VeChain X-Nodes, ITO and exchange
listings. The old ERC20 HKN token will still be tradeable on our listed exchanges until further
notice.

3.6 HAI Distribution
HAI distribution and lock-up model primary’s goals are:
•

Teams, partners, advisors, and equity holders have token lock-ups that depend on the user base
number. First lock-up milestone - 100,000 paid HackenAI subscribers.
The HAI marketing budget is going to be used mainly for user acquisition campaigns.
The HAI budget for technical development would be unlocked according to development needs,
after major application releases and synced with HAI listings at top exchanges.
Hacken will release semi-annual reports that will disclose key numbers of token usage. Major
decisions on marketing and development budgets will be voted on by major Hacken stakeholders, including fourth level stakers.

3.7 Use of Proceeds
At presale round, Hacken is raising 2 mln USD that will form a sufﬁcient budget for 1.5 years of
application development and marketing. The key milestone is to reach 100,000 paid subscribers,
which is our break even, according to the ﬁnancial plan.
The main ﬁnancial plan capital expenditures are as follows:

3.8 HAI Roadmap
Based on our tokenomics, we are not planning to issue all tokens at one time. First limited HAI
offering is going to be announced through ofﬁcial Hacken social media channels and is planned
in Q4 2019. Only 7.5% of tokens will be at circulation supply at ﬁrst listing.
The HKN swap and ﬁrst HAI/BTC trading pair will be introduced at the same time in Q1 2020.
Reserving a major part of tokens gives us a wide range of opportunities for the future app development without any limitations.

4. Legal
Hacken OU is an Estonian Private Limited Company. According to various studies, Estonia is
among the top seven countries regarding favorability of establishing a business and conducting
ITOs and IEOs. In addition to a favorable regulatory framework, it is easier and cheaper to start
and run a business in Estonia than in many other “ITO friendly” countries, such as Singapore,
Switzerland, USA, Malta etc. Estonia also has a history of supporting start-ups and new technological business ideas, which can be used in favor of a new business.
The Initial Token Offering of HAI utility token is conducted according to consumer protection
rules and the Advertising Act, for which the promotion of the product or service must be in line
with its characteristics and the Law of Obligations Act that establishes the contractual conditions
and obligations to which tokens that offer access to a product.

The next big step will be the MVP release of the app that is expected to be in the ﬁrst quarter of
2020. This event will be synchronized with the HKN swap and HAI/BTC trading pair introduction
at major cryptocurrency exchanges.
Each consequent quarter, app update releases will be accompanied with the secondary market
HAI listing at top cryptocurrency exchanges. Using this token distribution model, we can leverage
the supply side of maintaining the constant demand for HAI token.
Fourth level Ethical Hacker Stakers would be involved in the decision making process for application, marketing, and token development.
Teams, partners, advisors, and equity shareholder tokens are locked until certain user base milestone levels are met.

7. Summary
With HAI, we have created the ecosystem where both stakeholders and end users are beneﬁting
from the HackenAI application user base growth. The HackenAI app and the HAI token are going
to revolutionize mobile application market in the near future. We will see more and more unicorn
apps that are shifting their growing value from equity investors to application users. There is no
doubt that there is a need and niche for cybersecurity lifetime companion HackenAI. Let’s usher
in its success together.

The HAI token is not a security or a ﬁnancial instrument within the meaning of the Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) of the European Parliament (2014/65/ EU) or within

Participating in an ITO is a high-risk activity. This ITO in particular is only aimed at experienced
professionals who are experienced with blockchain technology, cryptocurrency trading and

especially, that they respect the above provisions.
