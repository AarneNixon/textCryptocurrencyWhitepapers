1. Introduction
Homihelp is Software as a service platform, which is comprised of an ecosystem of
customer support service , security tools and other future planned software
services which can be accessed by businesses, paying through cryptocurrency
only. Homihelp platform will generate the demand for cryptocurrency in
businesses world by selling SAAS products though cryptocurrency.
Homihelp is the self-funded platform by founders and still more advancements
and developments going on. No ICO will be launched for this token.
With a plan to introduce SaaS products for businesses and other daily use
business products for users and sell those products/services through
cryptocurrency, so that mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency can happen.

Billions of people are unable to interact with cryptocurrency as the daily software
they use have no real use or connectivity with crypto world. Homihelp is the
communication bridge that fills the gap between your customers and your
business. We provide omnichannel support tools for businesses to provide top
class support for their customers. Only extra feature will be use of cryptocurrency.

2. Mission
Homihelp is on mission to participate with other players in crypto market to bring
more people into crypto world and thereby increasing the value to crypto
currency outside decentralised world also.

3. Problem
Homihelp will try to solve the adoption problem. As in the business tools or apps
that are built as a decentralised apps (DAPPS) have seen very less adoption, out of
crypto and even inside crypto world also.

It may be due to scalability issues, user retention, sudden real-world adoption of
dapps is difficult, No product or service can become mainstream if they are hard
to grasp and present a lot of challenges when it comes to their usability. No doubt
with time things will get smooth. Ease of use is thus a major issue that negatively
affects user retention for DApps. Taking exchanges as examples, centralized
platforms still see more users than their decentralized counterparts owing largely
to the difficulty in navigating decentralized exchange (DEX) services.
According to the co-founder of Loom Network, James Duff‘ launching a semicentralized DApp and decentralizing it over time is “pragmatic’. After all, users
would like the software engineers to make changes to the products. Improving
them would benefit everyone.
As ‘Vitalik Buterin’ himself said ‘ It is much harder for participants in
decentralized systems to collude to act in ways that benefit them at the expense of
other participants, whereas the leadership of corporations and governments
collude in ways that benefit themselves but harmless well-coordinated citizens,
customers, employees and the general public all the time’.

4. Solution
Homihelp will try to solve the adoption problem. Firstly, giving users and
businesses fully centralized services and tools, but only adding cryptocurrency to
use these services and more than 90% people who knew about crypto world at
least know about trading and who don’t know about even train can be introduced
easily by guiding them or it’s the first thing they do while entering crypto buy/sell
tokens.
One step at a time guiding them from using crypto payments and then introducing
module wise decentralised features in these services they already using will be

easy to digest and understandable for normal users, rather than overflowing them
with all decentralised knowledge and tools.

5. What is Homihelp platform?
Homihelp is the communication bridge that fills the gap between your customers
and your business. We provide omnichannel support tools for businesses to
provide top class support for their customers.
