Project Risk and Risk Management
A. ​Regulatory

risk

At present, although some governments, such as Japan, hold a positive attitude towards
blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, and have established favorable policy to support
the growth of the industry, there are still many uncertainties at the regulatory level due to
conflicts between the decentralized nature of public blockchains and the policies of existing
centralized governments. Governments adverse to the proliferation of the use of
cryptocurrencies in local commerce could issue laws and regulation deeming the use of
cryptocurrencies a regulated activity. e.g. In recent weeks, countries such as China have
issued regulations or statements prohibiting token sales, while other countries like the U.S.
have sought to bring the sale of tokens within the same regulatory oversight as securities
offerings. This could result in holders of ETI being unable to use their coins in the future
without further regulatory compliance.
The management team will use the following ways to mitigate the regulatory risks:
• The team will set up a separate Public Relations department that will actively communicate
with relevant government authorities and industry practitioners, so as to design and carry out
its digital asset issuance, trading, blockchain finance, blockchain applications, and other
businesses under existing legal framework.

3

B. ​Market

risk

The ultimate goal of eInc is to enable organisations and individuals to run businesses on the
blockchain. However, since the blockchain industry is still in its infancy, the project will face a
variety of market tests in the future.
The Operations team will use the following ways to mitigate the market risks:
• eInc Operations team will attend industry meetings regularly and hold press releases on
project progress from time to time to communicate and discuss with relevant businesses
regarding current market needs and prospects. This can ensure that the project is able to
promptly respond to voices of the community and market.
C. ​Technical

risk

The goal of eInc is to establish a platform to run organisations on the blockchain, which is a
challenging task in terms of technology development. Therefore, the project puts a high
demand on top-notch technical talents and requires extensive research involvement and
engagement.
The Operations team will use the following ways to manage the technical risk:
• Work closely with top developer communities and research institutions to focus on the
development of the ecosystem.
• The eInc team will also regularly allocate funds to support the construction of eInc
community and carry out in-depth collaboration with other blockchain and crypto
communities, so as to ensure that the technical risks of the project are controllable.
D. ​Financial

risk

Financial risk refers to the significant loss of investment raised through Coinsale and Pre-sale.
For example, hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere
with eInc distribution or eInc blockchain in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to,
malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing
and spoofing.
The Operations team will use the following ways to manage the financial risk:
• All the digital currencies raised through Coinsale or Pre-sale are stored in multi-signature
wallet with cold storage and managed by the eInc team.
• Using 3/5 multisignature, the risk of project funds being subject to expropriation and/or
theft can be effectively reduced.

Abstract
The intent of EtherInc is to create an alternative protocol for running decentralized
organizations and building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs
that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with
particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely
used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are

4

important. EtherInc does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract
foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language,
allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can
create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition
functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, and other
protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty. Smart
contracts, cryptographic "boxes" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions
are met, can also be built on top of the platform, with vastly more power than that offered by
Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing-completeness, value-awareness,
blockchain-awareness and state.

Introduction
EtherInc (also referred to as eInc in short) is making DAOs a reality. eInc organizations are
borderless and decentralized, just like Bitcoin, that are not limited by demographies,
intermediaries and artificial restrictions.

The concept of distributed teams has gained momentum over the past few years. Working in
distributed teams opens up new possibilities and avenues.
The existing organisational system may work reasonably well when all the parties are a part
of a common organisation which is governed by an organisational structure and located in
one jurisdiction. However, this is not the direction where the organisations are headed.
Traditional businesses are being replaced by upcoming startup organizations where the
teams are no longer bound by geographies and jurisdictions.
According to a report published by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, there are more than
300 million entrepreneurs launching 150 million startups globally, each year. While this
number may seem impressive, it is only a third of these startups i.e. 50 million which actually
materialise, and hence benefit society in one or more ways.
Inspecting the reason behind failures of these new global organisations, insufficient capital
stands out as the most prominent factor. Organisations which fail, usually don’t have the
capital investment to sustain themselves for even six months, let alone the idea of turning
into successful ventures.

5

Some common roadblocks which the new organizations face are:
●

Different country specific compliances and regulations create friction

There are ever changing compliances and regulations which you must adhere to if you wish
to avoid penalties as high as $50,000 in establishing your organization. These regulations
tend to cause friction for startups and deter brilliant minds across the globe from
collaborating.
For example, if you are from Australia and your friend, let’s say, is from Ukraine, and both of
you wish to collaborate and start a company together, then there are a plethora of
documentation and country specific regulations (both of Ukraine and Australia) which you
need to adhere to.
You will also be required to hire a legal practitioner who will charge you a hefty fee for
documentation of contracts, payroll etc., aside from the bank charges, transfer fee etc.,
which you will encounter throughout the lifetime of your organization.
●

Heavy incorporation costs, prohibitive legal fees, high transaction charges, etc​.

Incorporating an organization often tends to involve a lot of paperwork as well as legal back
and forth which may appear as a burden on startups, which haven’t even started generating
revenue, let alone making profits.
For example, in ​incorporating a company in the U.S. there are the incorporation costs, EIN
number costs, state taxes, tax filing charges, insurance etc. which has been estimated to cost
a startup an upward of $7500+.
And this is just the cost encountered by organizations who have citizens of the U.S., as
founders. If you have founders from places other than the U.S., then the costs shoot up by
about $2000-$4000.

●

Costs involved in updating, managing and safeguarding company finances

Further costs are encountered in establishing a financial management system with a financial
consultant or a CFO heading all the operations. You will also be required to hire a chartered

6

accountant for managing your ledger, calculating profits, reducing costs, and disbursing
funds, where and when required.
●

Difficult procedure of conflict resolution

A company in its initial stages encounters a lot of disagreements and conflicts amongst its
founders as there are times when their opinions and thought-processes don’t match.
While the differences in ‘vision’ might get sorted before the company incorporation, there
are further issues which might arise between founders with respect to resource utilisation or
how to proceed further. Such situations demand a system of conflict resolution which ensures
that a company’s future isn’t put in jeopardy, simply because a decision couldn’t be made.
●

Complicated process of partner inclusion or exclusion

Working in a new startup organization, you are always prone to the risk of disagreement,
which eventually leads to one of your partners or stakeholders backing out, and hence,
leaving the future of you, your company and other partners in jeopardy.
Legal documentation and regulation-compliance may take years to iron out and bring
balance back in the organisations, giving stakeholders a chance to find loopholes within the
system, which they can exploit to turn the tide in their favour.
●

Angel Investors And VC’s have become discerning, while mechanisms like
Crowdfunding and ICOs have earned a bad name due to numerous scams

Witnessing a major market-crash at the end of dotcom boom, investors have turned choosy
with projects they wish to invest in. Now the chances of a startup securing funding from a VC
or an Angel Investor is 1 in 400.
While there are other ways of securing funds like crowdfunding, ICOs, etc., these methods of
raising money have got a bad name due to numerous scams, like ​this​, happening across the
globe, leaving the investors at huge risk.
In short, startups face trust issues because of the high costs of setting up a multinational
organisation, which might not be necessary, or financially feasible during the early stages of
the project.
Lack of organisation may result in disputes on various grounds like i distribution of profits,
reaching consensus through voting, raising capital from an external source, bringing new
members in an organisation, transfer of stake etc. Involving mediation in case of any dispute
can be expensive, an unnecessary nuisance, and often impractical.
There’s a need
●

To transform the entrepreneurship sector which currently has more than ​305 million
companies registered, and is growing at the rate of 100 million companies globally
annually.

●

To help almost 100 million startups which close shop each year due to a number of
reasons outlined above; inadequate cash reserve being the second highest one.

●

To encourage more than 5 million entrepreneurs, who are not funded by VCs and
Angel Investors, in bringing their ideas off the drawing board by helping them raise
funds via crowdsale, with confidence.

7

●

To shape a world where people around the globe can work together, as a single
organization, based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, and operate borderless,
permissionless, democratically, and transparently, with the consensus of its
shareholders, without the need of a trusted third party and/or costly intermediaries.

To summarize, eInc empowers teams around the world to create, manage, and operate
decentralized democratic organizations that are more resilient and trusted. This enables
efficient creation of value without borders, restrictions, and costly intermediaries or a trusted
third party. This is something like what Bitcoin has achieved in the payment space.
eInc Organizations that run with the consensus of its shareholders and operate
democratically, will protect the interests of the majority of the shareholders and boost
investor confidence.

Why we Forked Ethereum ?
We initially started eInc as a dApp (​https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/einc​ ) on
Ethereum Blockchain, after launching eInc platform we received many feedback and for mass
adoptions there was some issues (like: speed of ethereum was very low that time, gas
charges was too much) as a dApp on Ethereum blockchain. Moreover, the scalability
solutions were available at the cost of decentralisation. So we started looking for other
trusted blockchains and we considered ethereum classic, neo but we needed a blockchain
which has a wide range of support available so that user can interact eInc dApp easily &
developers can contribute to the eInc governance ecosystem. Moreover, NEO blockchain
operate on Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism using Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance
(dBFT) which is not decentralised as compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The need for purely
decentralised architecture where organisations can run without any intermediaries led us to
start the EtherInc blockchain. EtherInc blockchain offers both decentralization and bandwidth
needed to run global organisations.

EtherInc dApps
EtherInc blockchain based dApps will be same like Ethereum based dApps and any
Ethereum dApp can be deployed in EtherInc blockchain. We have created eInc dApp which
is the core dApp for all einc organisations.

8

eInc dApp
eInc dApp is a smart contract which has inbuilt protocols to run a organization. Every eInc
organization is actually a smart contract on EtherInc blockchain.

eInc controlled by its members

Example of eInc
View Ether eInc. on etherinc.org (einc organization explorer)
https://etherinc.org/company/0x5862acea137fc7ba78a6b1798e4c7d412e6a5/5c2

eInc WorkFlow
In eInc organisation everything is proposal based. if you need to do certain action like send
ETI to another address user need to create a proposal and when proposal pass ETI
automatically transferred to the beneficial address.

10

eInc Grades
Grade is the representation of power, ​less the grade more the power.
By Default minimum Grade for a member role is "1" which is assigned to "ceo". Grade "1"
can't be assigned to any other role and "ceo" grade can't be changed.
Every organisation can have different roles and grade, "10000" will be the Default grade for
any unassigned role.
Grades are divided into two parts:
●

Grades from 1-1000 can add new proposals and execute "Grade Based Proposals"
proposals of higher grades than their grades.

●

Grades above 1000 can't add new proposals or execute "Grade Based Proposals"
proposals.

eInc Proposal Types
There are total of 17 Types of proposals in a eInc smart contract which are further divided in
to two part:

Voting Based Proposals
Voting based proposals can only be executed / passed by voting on proposal. you can only
pass a proposal when positive votes will be greater than "Quorum Voting Percentage" of
total voting power, for eg: if a organisation has 100,000 total voting power and "Quorum
Voting Percentage" for that organisation is 51% then in order to pass proposal members
should vote at-least 51000 votes.
Proposals List:
● Issue Shares
● Investment
● Assign Shares
● Sell Shares
● Appoint CEO
● Fire CEO
● Payment / Salary
● Change Legal name
● Voting Rules
● Operational Proposal
● Close eInc
● Vote on Proposal (Remote eInc)
● Execute Proposal (Remote eInc)

Grade Based Proposals
Grade based proposal is slightly different from voting based proposals. In order to pass a
grade based proposal you need to have higher grade than proposal grade, for eg: if a
organisation member with "cto" role (5 grade) want to add a new member than he / she can
only execute proposal if new member has role which has higher grade than 5. In grade
based proposals there is no need for voting to pass proposal.

Anyone can Interect with eInc organization using eInc ABI here​:
https://etherinc.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/35000029608-i-need-abi-for-ei
nc-contract

eInc Name Service (eIncNS)
eIncNS is works same like WHOIS (​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS​), where all eInc will
be registered with there contract address and other metadata of eInc organization.
eIncNS will be launch in Q3, 2018. The main purpose on eIncNS is to make eInc
organizations more decentralized so that no one needs to only trust etherinc company.

How eIncNS will work ?
eIncNS will be a single smart contract which will have einc organisations metadata like: einc
organization name, contract address, renewal data, registrar etc. where people can register
as registrar and can register new eInc or renew einc on eIncNS by sending transations to
eIncNS smart contract.
What is the need of eIncNS ?
In the world of decentralized applications no one want to trust a single entity. because eInc
organization name will be unique worldwide and we need the process of registering and
renew eInc transparent we started creating eIncNS smart contract which will allow anyone to
check eInc organizations and because all details will be in blockchain so not even etherinc
can manipulate any data.

13

eInc Marketplace
eInc marketplace will consists of dApps, which will give eInc organisations a wide range of
applications to run their eInc as they want. one example of marketplace dApps are Payroll
dApp which will allow eInc owners to manage their employees and pay their salary
automatically without need of passing multiple proposals.

eInc marketplace dApps

EtherInc Blockchain Nodes
EtherInc officially launched Mainnet and Ropsten (TEST) Network (on ​Tue, 13 Feb 2018
16:21:28 +0000​) and during Coinsale we will give users Mainnet ETI coins. We have
launched total of 7 nodes in Mainnet and 3 nodes in Ropsten which is mentioned in Official
EtherInc Github (https://github.com/etherinc/go-etherinc) GETH protocol.

Use of ETI Coins
The crypto-fuel for the EtherInc blockchain, ETI coins can be used in many ways.

15

EtherInc Layers

The different layers of the eInc Platform
EtherInc Blockchain
eInc Blockchain was created as a fork of Ethereum on block 5078585. ETI (EtherInc) Coins are
the main internal crypto-fuel of EtherInc, and are used to pay transaction fees.
EtherInc Protocol
Peer-to-peer communications between nodes running eInc clients run using the underlying
eInc Protocol.
eInc dOrg + Utility dApps
eInc dOrg lets you run DAOs on “eInc framework”. One can use other utility dApps or create
their own dApps on top of it, for example, HR Bot dApp, Payroll dApp, etc.
Web3.js
Web3.js is a collection of libraries which allow one to interact with a local or remote eInc
Blockchain node.
eInc UI
eInc Organization Explorer (at ​etherinc.org​) lets one manage eInc, create proposals, take
actions on the eInc Organization and keeps a record of all the transactions.

16

EtherInc Mineable Coins
EtherInc blockchain which was started on ​Tue, 13 Feb 2018 16:21:28 +0000​ has a fixed time
for last block reward which is ​Fri, 07 Feb 2042 16:21:28 +0000, ​after this time no block
reward will be awarded to miners.

In Bitcoin we all know only 21M BTC can be mined over time by miners but we don’t know
exact time on which last block reward will be generated. On other hand in EtherInc we took
another route for this, instead of fixing supply we fixed time for last block reward which will
be before or on ​Fri, 07 Feb 2042 16:21:28 +0000.

17

Below is the graph to represent block reward over time.

EtherInc (ETI) block reward is 3 ETI and it will halves every 1095 days (~3 years) till ​Fri, 07 Feb
2042 16:21:28 +0000. ​Total of ~ 94,238,438 ETI can be mined over ~ 24 years.

* There will be no Uncle reward in EtherInc Blockchain.

18

EtherInc Fork Changes
EtherInc Blockchain was created as a fork of the Ethereum Blockchain, with replay
protection, and hence, has all the capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain with some of our
own enhancements, and powerful inbuilt dApps that run on this blockchain.
We improved the Ethereum Blockchain:
● Reduced block time from 15s to 6s which improved :
o Network transaction per second by 2.5x
o Transaction confirmation speed by 2.5x
o Miner reward by 2.5x
● Removed uncle reward
● Implemented finite supply for mineable coins

EtherInc Coin Distribution

Total Coins: 997,528,142 ETI
●

97,528,142 ETI​ ​will be distributed to Ethereum holders who had ETH in their wallet
balance at the time of the fork in the ratio 1:1.

●

100,000,000 ETI coins have been set aside for E
​ therInc Startup Fund t​ o support
startups that register their organization on​ ​einc.io

●

450,000,000 ETI coins will be available for sale in the eInc Coinsale.

●

100,000,000 ETI coins have be allocated for Strategic Partnerships such as
partnership with other Wallet partners to include ETI and partnerships that help
further build and foster the ETI ecosystem.

19

●

Only 150,000,000 ETI coins have been allocated for eInc Community. These coins
will be used to reward the founders, team members, advisors and fund the product
development, marketing, promotion, awareness, airdrop, bounty and referral
campaigns for the EtherInc platform, (30,000,000 ETI) will be company reserve for
miscellaneous operations.

●

100,000,000 ETI coins will be assigned for EtherInc future development and will be
vested for 5 years (​33.33% released in Year 3, 4 and 5​) .

Community Total Coins: 150,000,000 ETI
●

60,000,000 ETI coins will be available for development of etherinc.

●

37,500,000 ETI coins will be available for Team (will be vested for 6 months post
crowdsale).

●

30,000,000 ETI will be company reserve for miscellaneous operations.

We officially created two wallet options by forking existing open source code of MEW
(MyEtherWallet) and MetaMask. We implemented​ ​EtherInc blockchain configuration and
launched web wallet (https://wallet.einc.io) and chrome based browser extension eIncMeta
(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eincmeta/lghmfnfghfcjoblchpmlghkigcgakoag),
we choose to use open source code of MEW and Metamask because we user already know
how to interact with MEW and MetaMask and they don’t need to learn a new software in
order to send / receive ETI.
