Introduction
IQeon is a decentralized gaming PvP platform, which allows players to earn real money on their achievements. The
definition of “real money” and “money” in this document should be understood as any digital assets and means of
payment available as a result of the exchange of earned IQN tokens via available exchange services.

IQeon represents an infrastructure that will allow the integration of games, applications and services based on intelligent
and other types of competitions between users, as well as applications and services for motivation.

The name “IQeon” is not chosen by chance and is a combination of two concepts. Part of the name “IQ” implies a
common abbreviation of the term “intelligence quotient”. Part of the name “Eon” is a concept from ancient Greek
philosophy, meaning epoch, eternity, generation. These two concepts reflect the worldview of the project, which, in the
modern era of innovation, actually has human intelligence as a driver that guides the progress of humankind.

IQeon is the platform where players can earn money thanks to their intelligence and achievements. This will be realized
by using the internal currency in the IQeon ecosystem, which at any time can be converted to IQN tokens issued based
on Ethereum blockchain. IQN tokens will be available for exchange on exchange services.

Purposes of the project:
further development of IQeon platform;

creation of IQeon ecosystem;

formation of the audience of engaged platform applications and games users;

formation of partnerships with game developers and game content creators for the platform;

development of a line of IQ Clash owned games based on the platform.

1. Growth of the game industry
1.1. Mobile games and applications global market
Rapid growth in the number of mobile devices inevitably leads to increase in the number of mobile applications and
games users. According to the Newzoo 2017 Global Mobile Market Report, at the beginning of 2017 the number  
of smartphone users exceeds 2.3 billion, or 31% of the worlds total population. By 2020, this figure will reach 3.6 billion.

1.2. Features of mobile intelligent games market
According to GameAnalytics study in the field of mobile games and applications - classic games, card games, social
casinos, puzzles and word games show the highest retention. While quizzes show the highest 1st day retention, leaders
of the 7th day retention are board games, card games, social casinos, puzzles and word games. Leaders in the
engagement - board games, card games, social casinos, puzzles and word games.

The concept of the platform`s games also correspond to such genres as “casual”, “sports”, “arcade”, “educational” and
“multiplayer”. The number of downloads is not a determining indicator when monetizing applications. The number of
active users is much more important (we will consider the user retention parameters for 1 day, 7 days, 28 days, session
duration and user engagement).

40% day 1 retention is above average, but 35% is still promising

The 1st day retention rate is considered excellent if it is 40% or more. The median day 1 retention is about 25%. Within
each genre, the 1st day retention range varies greatly. The best median retention of the 1st day in the market is shown by
word games, almost reaching 35%. However, top retention rates for day 1 are held by quizzes (Trivia). For the best games
of this genre, 1st day retention can reach up to 48%.

Day 7 Retention
This metric reflects the percentage of users who returned to the game a week after the first game session.

According to GameAnalytics statistics, 14% is considered to be a good indicator of day 7 retention. The median retention
value of day 7 is 5%. Projects of few genres fall into the retention range of 15- 25% on the 7th day. They are: board titles
(Board), cards (Card), social casinos (Casino), puzzles (Puzzle), strategies (Strategy), quizzes and word games. Retention
of the 7th day at 10% is not achieved even by top games in the genre of racing (Racing) and music (Music).

Day 28 Retention
This metric reflects the percentage of users who returned to the game a month after the first game session.

Only in 15% of games, this figure reaches 5-6%. At the same time, the fall is observed in 2019. Analysts attribute this to
the fact that players began to leave games earlier.

The median value of retention on the 28th day is between 1-1.5%.

Games of most genres cannot overcome the bar of 10%. However, top games in such categories as board, card games,
casino, puzzle and word projects are capable of doing this.

At the same time, Game Analytics notes that for games with 6% or more retention on the 28th day, usually business is
going good.

Average Session Length
Analysts understand this metric as the time from the launch of the application to the moment when it is sent to the
background.

Important: a short game session is not necessarily bad, and a large one, on the contrary, is not necessarily good. But
under the same conditions (genre, visual style, mechanics used), the high duration of the game session indicates the
fascination of the game.

Only 15% of projects on the market have an average session of 11-12 minutes. And it is falling from month to month.
Back in June 2018, this parameter was about 14 minutes.

The median value of the average game session is 5-5.5 minutes. And it is also falling.

Among all genres, only two differ in session duration - card games and casinos. In the top games of these genres, users
spend an average of 25-35 minutes.

Multiplayer games also show good performance. In general, they have the highest median among all genres - 10
minutes, and for top games, the average session duration reaches 22-23 minutes.

Engagement (Stickiness)
The metric reflects the number of users who play each day during the month. Calculated by dividing DAU by MAU and
multiplying by 100%.

The engagement of the top 15% of games in the market is about 19%. GameAnalytics notes that if the game has a
stickiness of 18% — this is very good.

The median stickiness value on the market is about 8%.

The best involvement in the market is shown by casino games. The median average engagement rate in this genre is
above 20%. The top games of this segment can reach almost 30% engagement.

Card games also show a very good stickiness, it ranges from 8% to 28%.

ARPPU
ARPPU is the average revenue from a paying user. In this study, GameAnalytics only accounted for direct payments in
games. Advertising revenue was not taken into account.

The top 15% of games has ARPPU around $20. However, this metric varies greatly among the leading projects
depending on the season. It falls by Christmas season and then rebounds till the third quarter inclusively. This is easily
explained: during holidays, the paying audience increases. New users can, on average, pay much less than the main
paying audience of the game.

The biggest ARPPU is in action games, strategies and role-playing games (RPG). They have it at $27-31. While the best
median value for multiplayer games is around $15.

2. The problems of mobile

games market
2.1. Solutions, with the help of which you can get real money
while playing games are not widely used on the market.
According to data for December 2017, 97% of gamers do not have the ability to monetize their achievements in the
gameplay. The remaining 3% attempt monetization in the following ways:
specialized services and auctions (20%);

thematic forums (12%);

direct agreements between players (8%);

illegal exchanges (3%);
The remaining 57% of attempts to monetize cannot succeed
because of account being blocked by developers or because
of fraud, which leads to the loss of all virtual achievements.

IQeon solves this problem by using its own internal currency. When transferred to the personal account of the platform
user, the earned currency is exchanged for IQN tokens, which can then be freely exchanged for available digital assets
and means of payment on exchange services.

2.2. The market practically does not have any solutions that
allow organizing PvP competitions with fixing conditions and
automatic payment of gain to the winner.
Game scenarios of IQeon platform applications allow players to enter into a dispute staking the internal currency on a
certain achievement or event. The system will automatically pay the reward to the winner.

2.3. The authors of content for games do not have the ability
to monetize their groundworks without serious investments
in the development of technology solutions, for example,
mobile applications.
An application constructor based on the IQeon platform SDK will be implemented. With its help, game content
developers will be able to create new applications based on existing scenarios and game mechanics with minimal effort.

2.4. Receiving payments in mobile games and applications
through the App Store and Google Play is associated with
large commissions (30%).
The total commission for exchanging IQN tokens for other available digital assets and means of payment  
will not exceed 10%.

www.iqeon.io

14

2.5. The developers receive one-time earning for in-game
purchases.
IQeon platform allows the developer to get income from each stake. The platform uses the following system of charges
and rewards: players who want to make a stake or “fight” in one of the games, place equal stakes (for example, 50 IQN).
The overall amount of stakes makes 100 IQN, 88% of which comprises the stakes pool, that the winner will receive, and
12% (12 IQN) is the platform’s fee. 50% of the platform’s fee (6 IQN) is paid to the developer as a reward.

2.6. Bonuses and game points received in one game cannot

IQeon platform solves this problem by the possibility of exchanging the local currency for IQN tokens. The platform’s user
account can support the functions of synchronization and conversion of the internal currency on the balance of any
game or application of the platform into IQN tokens.

3. Advantages
3.1. Purposes of the platform
IQeon team develops a flexible and scalable platform for the rapid launch of new products that allow players to compete
in a variety of intelligent, logical and other tasks, receiving internal currency, which under certain conditions can be
exchanged for IQN tokens, for the best result.

Another direction for the development of IQeon platform are motivational applications. This direction is especially
important in the field of education, sports, and the observance of a healthy lifestyle. Often people do not have enough
inner motivation to study certain material, or force themselves to run in the morning, or lose several kilograms.

3.2. Technical advantages
The blockchain technology will guarantee reliability and anonymity of all payment transactions in IQeon system, and the
IQN token corresponds to the ERC20 standard, which makes it compatible with existing wallets and crypto-exchanges,
and allows its easy integration into a variety of products and solutions.

Fully supported by Ethereum blockchain, mechanism of smart contracts, on the basis of which IQN token is issued, will
provide permanence and reliability of the conditions of each competition, as well as a guarantee of winning.

3.3. Advantages of the platform for developers of

games/content
A ready developed infrastructure for the introduction of payments based on the IQN token into their own products;

The use of IQN tokens can be implemented in applications published in the App Store and Google Play;

Reduction of charges for developer fees withdrawal (from 30% Google Play and Apple Store  
to near 10% in IQeon platform);

Additional game audience for your own products;

API that allows quick integration of your products into an existing ecosystem;

SDK for rapid deployment of new applications based on IQeon platform.

www.iqeon.io

16

3.4. Advantages of the platform for players
Genericity. The internal currency IQeon, earned in one game, can be used in another one.

Liquidity. Using platform wallet it will be possible to exchange IQN tokens for available digital assets and means of
payment.

Convertibility. Using multiple third-party services and platforms, IQN tokens will be availiable for exchange to any
cryptocurrency (BTC, LTC, ETH, etc.).

Reliability. Thanks to the blockchain technology, all transactions of IQN tokens in the ecosystem are of no return; they
are repeatedly recorded in the decentralized transaction register, and thus are protected from forgery and any types of
fraud. The use of smart contracts will ensure that the terms and conditions of each dispute are recorded and
invariable and guarantee payment of the winnings.

Anonymity. IQeon platform allows players to remain anonymous.

3.5. Advantages of the platform for token buyers
Games and applications for self-development field shows rapid growth, and IQeon platform is the first
solution in this area that allows players to receive income in the form of liquid digital asset.

Developed partnership system, involvement of third party developers in IQeon ecosystem and
expansion of its own product line will lead to a growth in the audience of users and increase in demand
for IQN token.
IQN tokens could only be purchased at the minimal price during the Crowdsale period. The issue of IQN
tokens is limited. After the completion of Crowdsale, the purchase of IQN tokens is possible at the price
of the open markets.

4. Platform description
IQeon platform mainly focuses on the range of applications for self- development, logical games and PvP disputes.
Below are the developed scenarios for applications that will be implemented in the platform. This list will be constantly
supplemented in the process of platform development:

4.1. Scenario for motivation and self-development
This scenario assumes that two players place stakes on the fact that one of them (player A) will perform a certain action
(lose weight by X kilogram, go to college, hit a basketball in the basket 10-repeats, etc.). Each of them contributes the
same amount, which will be paid, after deducting the platform fee and developer’s reward (total 12%), to player A if he
performs the action, or to player B, if player A would not perform the described action.

All transaction terms pass through IQeon API to the blockchain and cannot be changed. After completing or not of what
is described in the conditions of the action, both players must confirm the corresponding result in the application.
Payment of rewards is accomplished through the mechanism of smart contracts.

For cases, if the players do not agree on the result of the dispute, the mechanism of remote conflict resolvers is
implemented in the application. Players can choose an arbitration option for their dispute, and a remote conflict resolver
will make a sound decision about the results of the dispute according to the materials provided (picture, video). An
additional charge for invocation of a conflict resolver will be deducted from the prize fund.

Both friends and unfamiliar with each other players can participate in the scenario. The second option will be
implemented through the listings of achievements. The first listing will contain requests from players “I’m ready to bet on
XX IQN that I will do ...”, and each player can respond to such a request. The second listing will contain the queries “I bet
on XX IQN that no one can do ...”, and again each player respond to this challenge.

www.iqeon.io

18

4.2. Scenario for PvP disputes
This scenario is similar to the previous one, however in such a scenario the dispute can be concluded for any event (the
result of a sports match, election results, the winner of Eurovision Song Contest, whether it will rain tomorrow, whether
the morning train will arrive on time, etc.) and between a group of players.

In addition, in this scenario, there may be differences in the mechanism for determining the results. For many events, the
result can be automatically loaded from the trusted resource API and entered into the system by a smart contract. In this
case, no confirmation of the outcome of the dispute is required by all players. If the result cannot be automated, the
approach described in the first scenario is applied. Arbitration is involved in disputable cases. 

The mechanism for fixing terms of the dispute and paying out winnings is also similar to the first scenario.

4.3. Scenario for educational applications
This scenario is applied to already existing and new services and applications of aimed at education (training courses,
learning foreign languages, etc.).

In such applications, online training is paid. The course usually consists of theoretical information, audio recordings,
video clips, and interactive assignments, tests for intermediate and final control.

For additional motivation of trainees, the following mechanism is applied: the user pays the cost of the course in IQN
tokens and starts training. For high results in tests, as well as for certain activities, the trainee receives a reward in IQeon
internal currency, thereby returning a part of the paid course cost. The application developer or the author of the course
determines what part of the cost (maximum) the learner can return in the form of rewards is determined.

4.4. Scenario for quest game with AR
The given scenario involves player’s passing of a sequence of levels for time. Each level represents an intellectual puzzle
for determining the location (park, public building, courtyard, bridge), after arriving at which the player looks for a code
placed with the help of AR or a hint that will help the player to give an answer to the current level. After entering the
answer in the application, the player moves to the next level, gets the next puzzle, etc. The quest is announced in advance
and starts for all participants at the appointed time. The participant who has passed all levels in a minimum of time wins.
The stakes pool is divided among the players who have taken the first 3 places, commensurate with the occupied
position and the di erence in the time of passing.

www.iqeon.io

19

4.5. Advanced scenarios
The IQeon team plans to expand the list of game scenarios using modern technologies, such as AI (Artificial Intelligence)
and VR/AR (Virtual / Augmented Reality) after the launch of the platform.

AI based on neural networks will use a constantly improving self-learning algorithm for creation and generation of logical
tasks.

VR/AR will add the games with contests implemented in virtual reality to the IQeon platform.

www.iqeon.io

5. IQ Clash API
5.1. Demo
Another scenario - the scenario of game rooms - has already been developed by IQeon team and implemented  
as an IQClash API, and the first application - “IQ Clash: Intelligent Battles” - is ready to be published in App Store  
and Google Play:

5.2. Scenario using game rooms
This scenario is based on the implementation of the game rooms in the application. The game room is a sequence of
logical tasks performed by the players during a certain time of the room period. To participate in the competition, the
player makes a contribution (stake). The sum of contributions, minus the platform charge and the developer’s reward,
forms stakes pool, which is then distributed among the players who took the first places (who showed the best result
when passing the tasks).

5.2.1. Public Rooms
Public rooms are available to all users and are displayed in a list on the application main screen. Two or more public
rooms with similar set of parameters (the number of participants and the stakes) cannot be available at the same time.

www.iqeon.io

21

Public rooms can be of two types:
Automatically created are 4 rooms created by the system are permanently in public access (for 2, 6, 12 and 24
persons). The rooms are created automatically instead of filled or expired.

Published private rooms are private rooms, at creation of which the user indicated that it should become public under
certain conditions (time frame or content). These rooms also obey one-time public access rule of only one room with
a certain set of parameters. Other rooms with the same parameters are queued at the time of compliance with the
publication conditions and are published when there is no public room with the same parameters and there is no
room with the same parameters created earlier in front of it. Such rooms will also be for 2, 6, 12 and 24 participants,
but stakes will be different.

5.2.2. Private rooms
Private rooms are created by user and are accessible only by a direct link. The user can share the link in any convenient
way (posting in social networks, sending a direct message, etc.). When creating a private room, the user selects room

6.3. Procedure for the tournament conduction
A player who wants to create a new tournament can do it through the IQeon web portal. When creating a tournament, the
name, the game, the dates, the amount of the participation fee, the requirements for the participants, the game mode, the
format of the tournament, the number of participants and the way the stakes pool is distributed are indicated.

Information about the tournament is published in a special section of the web portal, and all interested players register to
participate in the tournament. When registering, each participant specifies his ID for tracking match results (for example,
Steam ID), as well as the address of the cryptocurrency wallet.

After registration of the required number of participants, IQeon API forms a smart contract with the necessary conditions
for the tournament and publishes it in Ethereum network. The address of the smart contract for transferring contributions
in IQN for participation in the tournament becomes available in the personal accounts of the participants. 95% of the
collected amount of IQN forms stakes pool, 5% constitutes the commission of the platform from which payments for the
transactions in Ethereum network and remuneration to the resolvers are paid, and the rest is the reward of the platform.

After all the conditions necessary for starting the tournament are fulfilled, the stage of matches begins; the results of
each match are tracked through the platform API, to which the tournament game is connected. After each match, the
participants confirm their results in their personal account. A resolver is involved in case of controversial situations (for
example, the use of cheat codes) or in case of technical problems, (the match is not completed due to the network
disconnection). The resolver may decide to make a second match or disqualify one of the players for violating the rules
of the tournament. After confirmation of the results by the players or the decision of the resolver, the match results are
recorded in the tournament’s smart contract through IQeon API.

After receiving the results of all scheduled matches, the smart contract distributes IQN in accordance with the scheme of
the stakes pool distribution chosen at the stage of the tournament creation. The scheme above shows an example of the
distribution of winnings.

When creating a tournament, you can select several brackets and several winnings distribution schemes.

Not only the platform user, but also the sponsoring company may create the tournament. In this case, the tournament
participants do not pay the fees, and the organizing company sponsors the prize fund.

IQeon API. Provides a set of methods and interfaces for the interaction of all platform elements.

IQeon blockchain control subsystem. Implements services on interaction with Ethereum blockchain. It records
transactions with the use of IQN to blockchain, deployment and interaction with smart contracts.

IQeon web application. It is a platform portal. It contains information part (platform description, blog, documentation)
and user and developer personal accounts.

Users can link applications to their account, make purchases, transfers, exchange IQN for available digital assets and
means of payment through their personal account.

Developers can get API keys for their applications, register a new application in the platform, see statistics for accrual of
remuneration, and exchange IQN for available digital assets and means of payment through their personal account.

In addition, the personal account service replicates IQeon wallet application to web services.

www.iqeon.io

27

IQeon wallet. Is the application (iOS, Android), which allows the user to issue a debit card after verification and exchange
IQN for avaliable currency (and vice versa).

IQeon SDK. Is a creation tool set for rapid expanding of new games and applications based on existing scenarios and
game mechanics.

IQ Clash API. Is a set of methods and interfaces for agile development and integration of games and applications based
on the scenario of game rooms into the platform.

Existing games & services. Existing games and applications thanks to API can be integrated into IQeon platform. This
will allow existing games to take full advantage of the platform and use IQN token in the gameplay.

Ethereum wallet & Digital currency exchangers. IQN token complies with ERC20 standard. This means that it is initially
compatible with Ethereum wallets and can be freely transferred from one address to another. In addition, this standard
provides token’s genericity and technical compatibility for further listing on crypto-exchanges and digital assets
exchange services.

8. Legal aspects
Nowadays the legislation of most countries in the world to various extents toughen the requirements for online services
that allow earning money online. The team of IQeon project, together with legal advisors, studied the legislation of the top
countries for the project.

Experienced legal advisors helped IQeon project to create its own concept of mobile games, applications and services,
which should be in demand among an expanding audience of cryptocurrency users. IQ Clash software products and
platform partner products that support transactions using the IQN token must comply with legal requirements, and
IQeon platform users’ expectations regarding the benefits of using our products and the ability to receive money should
be justified.

IQeon platform focuses on the range of applications for self-development, logical games, games of various genres and
PvP disputes. The use of digital assets in the internal transactions in such software products does not encounter
opposition from the official authorities if the transactions comply with the requirements of applicable law. This is
possible due to the fact that fiat money will not be stored on the balance of users in IQeon games and applications.

12. IQN token
12.1. IQN - ERC20 standard token
IQeon is not just a platform, but also a whole ecosystem, which will include application and content developers, platform
partners and millions of users. The internal economics of the ecosystem cannot exist without its own currency, the role
of which will be performed by IQN token.

IQN token was released on the basis of Ethereum platform and fully complies with ERC20 standard. Support of this
standard guarantees the compatibility of the token with third-party services (wallets, exchanges, listings, etc.), and
provides easy integration with these services. Ethereum platform fully supports Dapps concept thanks to the integrated
Solidity language for writing smart contracts that will be used to implement a number of functions in IQeon platform
(payment transactions, fixing of disputes terms, paying out of winnings and rewards).

The release of our own tokens is driven by the need to raise funds for further platform development, as well as the need
for internal economy of the ecosystem that, thanks to the advantages of blockchain technology, will be based on
transparent and trusted relations between all participants, thereby enabling a more efficient business model for using the
platform.

Tokens that make up the bonus fund were uniformly spent during 12 months.

12.3. Functions of IQN tokens
By purchasing IQN tokens, you receive an asset the use cases, value and liquidity of which can increase with the platform
development, expansion of user audience and implementation of planned functionality.

However, the main idea of tokens is to use them directly in IQeon platform for the following purposes:
two-way exchange for internal currency - IQeon, in which stakes are made, remunerations in game rooms, disputes,
motivation applications, remuneration for a certain activity are paid (player of the day, player of the month, etc.);

payment of game developers remuneration;

payment of remuneration to digital content copyright owners;

payment of remuneration for partner programs;

forming the stakes pool in tournaments based on IQeon platform.
Herewith, the use of IQN token is not limited only by the platform ecosystem. After the final launch of the platform, IQN
token will be available for exchange on the cryptocurrency exchanges and digital asset exchange services.

The value of IQN token will be provided by limited emissions, a constant need for the game process, as well as the ability
to convert to other avaliable digital assets and means of payment. The disbalance of tokens will be eliminated thanks to
the well-considered IQeon ecosystem economy, which provides token circulation.

12.4. Legal status of IQN tokens
IQN tokens are designed for applicative use in IQeon ecosystem and, according to the generally accepted classification
of tokens, correspond to the characteristics of utility tokens. IQN tokens cannot be returned after purchase at preICO and
ICO stages. Tokens can be used inside IQeon ecosystem including exchange for other digital assets and means of
payment. The purchase of IQN tokens in the period of preICO and ICO is not an investment agreement and cannot be
treated as making investments. IQN tokens are not securities. Possession of IQeon tokens is not treated as ownership of
shares, and owners of IQN tokens do not have ownership, management, or any other rights with respect to IQeon
ecosystem.

IQN tokens are purchased as a digital asset, like downloadable software, digital music, etc.
