Referrals on the blockchain

White Paper
25th January 2018

White Paper
Refereum provides referrals on the blockchain, built for the game industry.
Refereum is the first referral marketplace for games. The RFR token rewards
gamers for their engagement and purchases with full transparency. Over 150,000
gamers have joined the platform in the two months since launch, and the number of
gamers continues to grow exponentially.
The Refereum solution can be extended easily into other verticals. Our team
is made up of veteran game industry experts and world-renowned blockchain
specialists.

Executive Summary
The Problem
Referral marketing is the most effective conversion tool to acquire new
customers, but untrustworthy actors and expensive micro-payments have
blocked its ability to scale. This is nowhere more apparent than in the gaming
industry.

The video games industry is $109B and growing at 6% annually.
In recent years, the number of gamers has exploded -- today, 2.2B people play
games, making it the single most popular digital entertainment content on any
device. 1 2
Inevitably, social platforms like YouTube and Twitch have created strong gaming
communities, and influencers and streamers now command promotional power
and unprecedented reach. The top 10 influencers have an audience of 242m, double
that of the recent Superbowl audience.
Gaming is now a booming professional sport (i.e. “eSports”) with the highest growth
in the industry. International “supergamer” competitions can fill stadiums that rival
those that host traditional premier sporting events. The 2016 International Dota 2
Championship, the richest eSports tournament had a prize of $21m, double that of
The Masters. Professional gamers are fundamentally changing the market dynamics
by bridging the private gaming world and the public sporting arena.

Marketing is critical to drive customer acquisition and usage, but costs are
skyrocketing.
The gaming industry spends approximately $20B in advertising and marketing 4 and
these costs are increasing fast.
Competition among game developers is intense. Blockbuster game developers now
spend 2-3x the development cost for marketing and advertising through traditional
channels to create “buzz” for their games. 5 At the same time, online customer
acquisition costs are also rising.
A few dominant platforms capture the majority of advertising dollars and broadly,
an average of 30% of developer revenues in distribution fees.

Referral marketing, a way to promote products through word-of-mouth, is
a powerful channel and the most effective conversion tool.
Compared to other marketing channels, referred consumers have the best
conversion to purchase, longer retention, and a higher lifetime value.
Referral through friends is the single most trusted form of advertising, 6 people are
4x more likely to buy when referred by a friend, 7 and the Lifetime Value of new
customers via referrals is 16% higher than those that are not referred. 8 Gamers,
more than in any other entertainment medium, place an even higher trust on
referrals, as the community is especially tight-knit and highly opinionated.

Despite proven effectiveness, referral programs are difficult to track and
compensate.
These campaigns suffer from fraud (e.g. fake influencer accounts, clickbots),
reporting disparities between developers and platforms, leading to a loss of revenue
for influencers, and many expensive intermediaries.
While industry giants can amplify a brand’s message through sharing, even they lack
a mechanism to track the conversion funnel fully, from initial awareness all the way
to a purchase.
Influencers are powerful agents of referral marketing. But again, no technical
mechanism exists to track and pay an individual conversion for each view, like, share,
or recommendation into a direct sale. The current approach requires developers to
identify influencers manually, cold-contact them one by one, and negotiate unique
deal terms, generally in the form of sponsorships.
The process is time-consuming, costly, nebulous, and lacks measurable goals.
Moreover, it is nearly impossible to reward players with fiat currency because
of cross-border banking complexities and geopolitical restrictions. As a result,
influencers and engaged fans are not compensated accordingly.

Refereum Solution
Refereum resolves these problems around referral marketing in the video
game industry.
Smart contracts established directly between developers and gamers create a
decentralized, secure, and transparent marketplace with a record of purchases and
referrals written into the Blockchain.
Our solution eliminates fraud, layers of middlemen, various onerous fees, and
redistributes marketing budgets to gamers and influencers instead. Our solution
transfers value from ad agencies and other intermediaries to influencers and gamers
directly.
Game developers can purchase RFR tokens to reward influencers and players
for specific actions; in turn, gamers can buy or earn tokens for their actions (e.g.
streaming a new game), which can then be used to purchase more games or
converted to cash. This active engagement between developers and gamers
enables a continuous feedback loop, driving network effects and exponential
growth.
Refereum allows anyone to participate without requiring a bank account. We are
also an official partner of the Connext API, which allows average consumers to
purchase RFR tokens securely with conventional payment methods like credit cards.

Refereum benefits all participants in the ecosystem:
•

Developers can improve their marketing campaigns. They no longer have

•

Influencers can monetize their following. Any streamer or influencer,

•

Even the average gamer can share in the token economy just for doing
what they love. Simply by sharing links or moving up a gaming level, anyone

to pay huge upfront fees for campaigns that do not provide strong ROIs. They
can reward individuals directly, after a successful purchase. The blockchain
solution removes fraud and legal paperwork to reward not only for the purchase,
but also a variety of call-to-actions. It enables microtransactions of $0.0001 for
completing a tutorial to $1m for winning an eSports tournament.

regardless of the size of their following, no longer has to wait to be approached
by ad agencies for campaigns, and instead, can choose relevant and monetizable
content for their followers. Influencers with niche yet active audiences who may
not have been sponsorship material previously, can now potentially earn a living.

can earn RFR tokens. The blockchain referral ecosystem will now allow the
99% of gamers that actually make up the vibrant community to participate
economically as well.

Company Momentum
We launched our service in November 2017 and have grown to over 150,000 gaming
enthusiasts; we expect to see continued exponential growth. We are integrated into
the Twitch API, the leading video game streaming service, and offer tools by Unity,
the most prominent game development platform. Both are excited by and support
Refereum’s vision and project.
Beyond gaming, the global marketing and ecommerce industry is ripe for disruption
by smarter decentralized technology. A portion of the $558B typically spent on
advertising can instead be redistributed to individual consumers. We plan to
move into other verticals where influencers command a powerful voice, such as
entertainment, retail, fitness, beauty, travel, and more.

Team
Our team is comprised of games industry veterans (from Unity, EA, IGN, Zynga,
Ubisoft, Google) and world-renowned white hat cryptographers (Chronobank,
Polybius). Our advisors are leaders of Facebook’s user acquisition teams.

Industry Dynamics
Game Developer
Video games is a busy industry with many developers but few distributors.
With lower barriers to entry, the number of game creators has increased significantly.
A few key players dominate digital distribution and capture the majority of the
games advertising revenues. In addition, all top platforms charge 30% of revenue
to simply distribute digital products, further increasing their grip with game
developers.

Developers have to spend more and more on conventional advertising

A scalable solution
to directly involve or
engage players does
not exist

channels to reach gamers. Targeting specific players
can be exasperating: developers often have no choice
but to pay major digital distributors for in-stream
advertising or sponsored content in social media.
A scalable marketing solution to directly involve or
engage players does not exist.

Advertising algorithms and policies are opaque
While ad networks have improved immensely on their ability to target, there are
still problems with transparency. Dominant channels impose rules that can easily
change at any moment without consultation from game developers or the wider
community. That means that developers are left rather powerless when it comes to
marketing their games.
There have also been several instances where ad platforms have indicated flaws in
the metrics they have reported to advertisers, such as overstating app referrals, and
inflating the amount of time consumers had watched video ads. At other times, ad
platforms have changed policies that demonetized content, leaving content creators
demotivated and sometimes terrified at the sudden loss of revenues. This reflects
an opaque system in which the key players define the metrics, exercise full rights
over how their ad algorithms can be managed, and have minimal external oversight
or audit controls.

Referral Marketing
Since the start of society, decision-making and purchasing behavior have revolved
around social influence. Referral marketing is considered the key factor in countless
success stories, such as Amazon, Dropbox, Uber, Airbnb, and Tesla. Social relevance
provides a stronger backbone, particularly in game-playing communities where
multiplayer engagement is driven by groups and trends online.
Referral success is well documented as the most
effective strategy. Offers with recommendation
by referral are accessible, relatable, targeted, and
trustworthy. Developers who design referrals on
social media platforms like Facebook have created
some of the highest grossing games ever. In just
one year, game companies that used referrals saw
growth from 3 million to 40 million average daily
users.

Offers with

referral are accessible,
relatable, targeted and

Attracting the right influencers is crucial to a successful referral marketing
strategy.
Agencies (e.g Speakr, Instabrand) have emerged to try to match brands to
influencers. But the process is just time-consuming, costly, often nebulous, with
disputable tracking, and lacking measurable goals, e.g. converting and paying
each view, like, share, comment, thumbs up into a direct sale is complex and
unaffordable.

As an example, in 2016, companies spent $570m on sponsored posts on Instagram.
Many such posts fail to reach their audience as algorithms filter out much of the
content, reaching only 8-18% of the intended audience. 12 13 In addition, most brands
still emphasize reach (i.e. number of followers) over true engagement. Influencers
therefore can feel pressure to ‘buy’ likes and followers as a way to increase their own
prominence.
This further adds to the charts above indicates that 70% of an individual’s motivation
to play a mobile game is based on recommendations by friends; at the same time,
marketers say that the biggest challenges in working with influencers is identifying
them (73%), measuring ROI (65%) and engaging with the influencer (59%).
So, while referral marketing can be a very powerful tool for developers, current
technologies are not able to capture its full potential.

Influencer
Influencers are a growing phenomenon in gaming
They have an impassioned and loyal fanbase that was previously only possible for
high-profile entertainers and political figures. Gaming effectively has the largest
reach of any vertical in social media, where the top 10 influencers gather an
audience of 242 million. 14 These gamers leave reviews, recommend games to each
other, share their gameplay and interact with fans in real time (e.g. via chats) on key
gaming platforms. Games like Dota 2 surpass 32m viewers compared to just 20m
for Sunday Night Football.

By sharing their gameplay and interacting with fans in real time, Twitch and YouTube
influencers draw massive attention to the games they play. Gamers making videos
and streaming games have become a billion-dollar industry in themselves.

Influencers are not properly compensated relative to their efforts
In the current ecosystem, most gamers and influencers are rarely rewarded with
the monetary potential of their fanbase. A few elite influencers (e.g. PewDiePie with
59m subs or Markiplier with 8m subs) have created their own mini-media empires

11

that are more professionally run, earning money via YouTube ads, sponsorships, and
licensing deals. But the vast majority of influencers are limited in how they can
generate income. While a new generation dreams of becoming full-time streamers,
barriers to entry are high and they face the constant challenge of sustaining an
income.

In the current ecosystem,
most gamers and
influencers are rarely
rewarded with the
monetary potential of their
fanbase.

Current compensation methods have fallen prey to
numerous examples of large centralized platforms
changing policies to the detriment of individuals.
Currently, streamers deploy dozens of complicated
techniques, from disruptive banner ads to
unrelated endorsements in a largely unsuccessful
attempt to monetize content.

While streamers waiting for donations is the normalized status quo, it’s not
capitalizing on their potential in the industry.

12

Architecture and Implementation
Refereum is based on referrals and is built on Blockchain technology. It allows
developers to promote their games by buying RFR tokens which can then be
distributed to influencers and gamers for engaging in a variety of activities, e.g.
referring, buying, and playing games. Meanwhile, gamers can buy RFR tokens from
developers or each other on the exchange. The platform fundamentally incentivizes
users to engage with each other beyond initial purchases (e.g. chatting on Discord).

Blockchain Introduction
Blockchain has the potential to change fundamentally how we conduct business.
One of the most profound impacts will come in the way we interact at a peer-topeer level and how wealth can be distributed intelligently based on smart contracts,
rather than controlled by a few dominant firms.
The blockchain is a new ecosystem, and its philosophy revolves around
decentralization. It has transparency and an inherent freedom from geographical
constraints, legacy payment systems, censorship, and middlemen. Today, this
economy surpasses $550B.
The value of a cryptocurrency (i.e. a token) lies in the fundamental value it offers as a
tool. An Ethereum (ERC20) token is programmed with the information of a contract
between two parties, the wallets of potential recipients, and a way of determining
the outcome objectively. As an example, imagine a game of heads or tails. Two
people can write a contract to bet money on the outcome of a coin toss. What if the
contract was written on — or rather, in — the flipped coin? This is a smart contract
which is programmed into the token.
The blockchain can be used to resolve the specific issues of referral marketing in the
video game industry. It has been impossible to reward players with fiat currency
because of complex legislative and geopolitical restrictions, but the Refereum
solution removes such barriers.
For an economic system to maintain or grow, there needs to be an ecology of
needs, suppliers, and innovators. The Refereum economy is primed with developers,
gamers, and influencers.

13

RFR Token
To revolutionize the game industry, we are building on the foundation of the
Ethereum Blockchain to create a platform that, until now, has been impossible.
The architecture of the RFR token is core to the technology and complies with the
ERC20 standard.15
Participating parties can already interact with the system using a wide variety of
Ethereum clients. Refereum is featured as an official partner of the Connext API to
allow the purchase of RFR securely with conventional payment methods like credits
cards for average consumers.
By utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, Refereum provides a secure, reliable, and
auditable way for game developers, influencers, and gamers to come together
and be rewarded. While the Refereum platform provides tools to simplify and
encourage engagement between these groups, the RFR token will be able to
transfer from any user to any other user without interacting with the Refereum
platform. This shifts further control of the decentralized virtual currency to the
community.

Mechanism to purchase RFR Token
Purchasing a game with Refereum tokens on Refereum.com is one of
the quickest and easiest ways to get value from the blockchain. With the
widely adopted MetaMask Chrome plugin, users can buy games with just
2-clicks directly in their browser. Additionally, we allow users to sign their
own blockchain transaction and make a purchase manually by calling the
TransferToIcap() function of our smart contract.
Users can chose ease of use or full control, whichever they prefer. Once a transaction
in the Refereum ICAP address space is confirmed, the game key is automatically
shown in the users web account and a receipt of the transaction, in the form of an
Ethereum transaction, is stored on the blockchain forever. The transaction record
specifies which game was purchased by which user, and this is auditable by players
and developers alike without the need for Refereum’s interaction without linking
addresses to accounts.

Mechanism to reward RFR Token
We believe in the open source approach for security, developer ease of use, and
further adoption of the platform. Usage of the open source blockchain rejects
centralization of control and mandates transparency. We have already created
an open source example of earning (testnet) Refereum inside a game for anyone
to see on Refereum.com and help them model their own games. As developers
contact us to implement further rewards for influencers, they might look toward
other applications of Refereum for best practices. Simple or widely useful

14

implementations will be stored in a public and easily accessible repository with
detailed documentation.

ICAP
ICAP, the Inter exchange Client Address Protocol, is a feature of the Ethereum
blockchain that allows transfer of funds between 3rd party accounts. By utilizing this
technology the Refereum platform can securely track the source of an Ethereum
transaction without the user needing to supply any of their private information. A
unique ICAP address is generated for any user that specifies which game they are
purchasing. By utilizing MetaMask, users are freed from needing to enter their ICAP
address as Refereum automatically generates the transaction for the user to simply
review before submitting onto the blockchain.

RFR Smart Contract
Contract ERC20 {
function totalSupply() constant returns (uint totalSupply);
function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance);
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);
function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool success);
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint remaining);
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value); }

Use Cases / Utility Today
We invite you to watch the video walkthrough of how easy it is to use RFR tokens
today on Refereum.com.
The top 3 virtual currency utility uses of RFR tokens today are:

1.

Anyone can buy games on Refereum.com using RFR tokens and view
their receipt on the blockchain

2.

Game developers can pay RFR tokens to feature their game and sponsor
additional engagement on Refereum.com

3.

Sellers of digital goods can pay to list their products for distribution by paying
RFR token

Developer
Radical Studios have spent their savings creating an awesome new game. Before,
the studio had to spend money on ineffective Facebook ads — or hire an expensive
marketing agency that ended up providing mixed results.
With Refereum, Radical Studios adds their game to the Refereum platform and
offers a high referral bonus for anyone who refers purchases of their game. Instead
of paying 30% to traditional distribution platforms, they can choose to share 10% of
profits with streamers who help sell their game via referrals and create content for it.

Influencer
Rachel is trying to make it as a full-time streamer on Twitch. She has a following, but
she’s certainly not in the top 1% of streamers. Before, Rachel had to wait and hope
that strangers would donate to her stream.
Now, Rachel can use Refereum.com and find relevant games for her fans. Rachel
and her fans have access to cheaper games and cash rewards for any purchases
made through her referral link. She can trade her tokens to finance her career or
buy more games to stream

16

Gamers
Rod enjoys watching streams of video games but is starting to wonder if there’s
more productive use of his time.
With Refereum, developers attract gamers like Rod to new games, so Rod is now
paid for engaging (by watching or playing) with new games. Rod can use this same
virtual currency to buy more games.

Open Initiatives
We believe in the open source approach for security, developer ease of use and
further adoption of the platform. Usage of the open source blockchain rejects
centralization of control and mandates transparency. We have already created
an open source example of earning (testnet) Refereum inside a game for anyone
to see on Refereum.com and help them model their own games. As developers
contact us to implement further rewards for influencers, they might look toward
other applications of Refereum for best practices. Simple or widely useful
implementations will be stored in a public and easily accessible repository with
detailed documentation.
We have created a solid foundation and look forward to working closely with the
open source community to provide the best technical solutions.
All transactions of the Refereum utility token are tracked on the Ethereum
blockchain. This allows developers to see exactly how many copies of their game
are selling and influencers to track how many people are buying games from their
recommendation.

Refereum streamers are constantly sending us screenshots of their great results with the
platform as seen below. Below, a screenshot from ‘DownToQuest’ is featured:

Customers
Some of the largest and most well known companies in the game industry are already
using the Refereum platform today. For instance, Epic Games (Unreal tournament, Gears
of War, etc) have sponsored Refereum with their top Twitch game ‘Fortnite’ to attract more
streamers and downloads. The platform has provided tens of thousands of downloads and
other game purchases.

Industry Support
Platform adoption has been accelerated by Refereum’s integration with Twitch,
the most popular and established game streaming platform; and Discord, the
communication tool popular with gamers. Both Twitch and Unity, the world’s
most popular game engine, have voiced support for the Refereum solution
to see on Refereum.com. In addition, any of the users who gain access to
tokens can use them on Refereum.com for redeemable game keys on existing
distribution platforms. Developers can already add their games to sell, or
incentivize influencer traffic with Refereum tokens. With open source code for
this technology, the Refereum team has created a strong foundation for this
Blockchain technology platform.

“ We strive to help streamers and game
developers. We know Refereum shares these
goals, and we plan to keep collaborating on the
future of game streaming.”
— Ernest Le, Director of Publisher & Developer
Partnerships at Twitch

Influencers’ streams are well on the way to replacing TV. 16 17 When Amazon
purchased Twitch for nearly $1 billion, some were surprised that a website dedicated
to watching people play games could be worth so much.
A closer look at its user base, user engagement, and user retention statistics shows
why Twitch is so valuable. Twitch has over 1 million unique broadcasters creating
6 million videos a month. These videos attract 45 million unique gamers a month,
each of whom watch this content for an average of 1.5+ hours a day. 18
Reaching out to all these individuals separately is an impossible task, but offering
systematic incentives is easy on the Refereum platform. In this latter scenario,
campaigns do not have to be hand-targeted towards specific individuals; instead,
engagement is driven by influencers themselves checking the platform. The content
they create is already an ad for the game itself, and Refereum capitalizes on this.
Additionally, Refereum works across country borders with other top streaming
platforms like Korea’s Afreeca and China’s Huya and Douya with simple referral links.
Before Refereum, there were no marketing solutions that thrived in these intimate
and real-time relationships between influencers and their fans. These incentives
provide the perfect foundation for growth on a viral curve, as it offers the easiest and
most effective way for influencers to monetize their passion.

19

“We plan to support Refereum tools and
assets to help developers keep being
successful with Unity.“
— Ian Dunlap, Asset Store Manager at Unity

Unity is the most used game engine ever. It has the largest market share of
developer use and it deploys to every gaming platform — from mobile to VR. Unity
games have been downloaded 5 billion times 19 by players on over 2.4 billion unique
devices. 20 From their asset store, Unity will provide an asset that offers one-click
implementation of Refereum tools for any developer in its immense ecosystem.
Further integration of Refereum is an especially easy implementation for the
majority of game genres that already rely on any virtual currency to progress or
use Unity. Such tool allows developers to implement Refereum into any current or
future game with ease.
With trivial deeper implementation in response to the community for any game
engine (including Unreal, Crysis, Lumberyard, custom engines, and more), Refereum
removes barriers for developers using blockchain technology.

Growth Prospects
Referral marketing done well is a very powerful strategy to drive business. Refereum
has purposely focused on gaming industry because it is where our heart is, but
also because it is the best testing ground for this revolutionary technology. But in
practice Refereum is totally industry agnostic. Smart contracts can be created for
anyone eager to leverage the power of referral marketing to achieve a certain goal.
2018 will be a very busy year for the team, and our sole focus will be on becoming
the go-to platform for gaming. But pretty soon we will test appetite in adjacent
industries such as entertainment in general, as well as other industries where
influencers have proven to be a powerful voice in their respective fields. Think of
fitness, beauty products, pets, kids, technology products, travel, retail, auto.
The point here is that Refereum is adopting a solid strategy. Become the best in the
industry you love, then expand for others to benefit.

Disclaimer
TO ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS:
THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY PROVIDED IN THIS WHITE PAPER DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE, AND
IS SUBJECT TO AND QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL TEXT OF THE TOKEN SALE
MEMORANDUM, AND OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS, WHICH WILL BE PROVIDED TO EACH PROSPECTIVE
PURCHASER UPON REQUEST.
PROSPECTIVE TOKEN PURCHASERS SHOULD NOT CONSTRUE THIS WHITE PAPER AS PROVIDING ANY LEGAL
OR TAX ADVICE. THIS WHITE PAPER CURRENTLY CONTAINS A FAIR SUMMARY OF REFEREUM’S VISION, AND
THE OPERATION AND UTILITY OF ITS TOKEN. FURTHER INFORMATION WILL BE PROVIDED IN ITS TOKEN SALE
MEMORANDUM, INCLUDING THE MERITS AND RISKS INVOLVED IN PARTICIPATING IN REFEREUM’S TOKEN
SALE. PARTICIPATION IN A TOKEN SALE CAN BE HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND COULD INVOLVE A RISK OF TOTAL
LOSS. A PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER SHOULD THOROUGHLY REVIEW THE TOKEN SALE MEMORANDUM UPON
ITS RELEASE AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER PURCHASING RFR TOKENS IS ADVISABLE GIVEN THE
PURCHASER’S FINANCIAL POSITIONING AND GOALS. THIS WHITE PAPER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE THE OFFERING
OF A SECURITY. THE REGULATORY TREATMENT OF TOKEN SALES IS A LIVE AND DEVELOPING ISSUE, AND NO
ASSESSMENT IS CONCLUSIVE. REFEREUM TAKES THE POSITION THAT ITS RFR TOKEN IS NOT A SECURITY,
BUT A UTILITY TOKEN GIVEN ITS OPERATION AND IMMEDIATE FUNCTIONALITY. AS SUCH, RFR TOKENS, HAVE
NOT AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED OR FILED UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF ANY
JURISDICTION. FURTHER, THIS TOKEN SALE IS NOT BEING PROVIDED THROUGH ANY OF THE EXEMPTIONS
UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT. NO REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAS CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY
OF REFEREUM’S SELF-ASSESSMENT THAT ITS TOKEN SALE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SECURITIES OFFERING.
ALTHOUGH DUE DILIGENCE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED, AND REFEREUM HAS TAKEN STEPS TO MITIGATE
REGULATORY RISK, GIVEN THAT BLOCKCHAIN IS A YOUNG INDUSTRY, AND TOKEN SALES ARE A NOVEL AND
EVOLVING DEVELOPMENT, THERE IS INEVITABLY A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH ANY TOKEN SALE. GIVEN
THE RAPIDLY CHANGING REGULATORY LANDSCAPE AND WARNINGS SIGNALED BY MULTIPLE INTERNATIONAL
JURISDICTIONS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL FOR TOKENS TO BE VIEWED AS SECURITIES OFFERINGS, THERE
IS ALWAYS A RISK THAT THE RFR UTILITY TOKEN MAY NOT BE PRECLUDED FROM SECURITIES REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. MANY INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS
HAVE INDICATED THAT TOKEN SALES MAY QUALIFY AS SALES OF INVESTMENT CONTRACTS, OR QUALIFY AS
CROWDFUNDING SALES UNDER PRE-EXISTING REGULATIONS, AND MAY BE REGULATED AS SUCH. IN VIEW OF
THE GUIDANCE RECENTLY RECEIVED FROM THESE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, IT IS LIKELY THAT A GROWING
NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WILL BE CLOSELY SCRUTINIZING TOKEN SALES. REFEREUM’S REPRESENTATIONS
AND SECURITIES ASSESSMENT IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION (SEC) OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY WILL NOT DETERMINE THE TOKENS TO BE
SECURITIES SUBJECT TO REGISTRATION. THE RFR TOKENS HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED
BY THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION IN
THE UNITED STATES, OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY IN THE UNITED STATES. THE SAME APPLIES
TO RELEVANT REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED ANY FORM OF GUIDANCE AS TO INITIAL COIN OFFERINGS AND TOKEN
SALES, SUCH AS ABU DHABI, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, DUBAI, GIBRALTAR, HONG KONG, ISRAEL,
JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIA, SINGAPORE, SOUTH KOREA, SWITZERLAND, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE
FOREGOING AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY OR DETERMINED THE ADEQUACY OF ANY
INFORMATION IN THIS WHITE PAPER OR THE TOKEN SALE MEMORANDUM, NOR IS IT INTENDED THAT THE
FOREGOING AUTHORITIES WILL DO SO. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY WOULD BE A CRIMINAL
OFFENSE. SHOULD REFEREUM’S TOKENS BE DEEMED SECURITIES BY THE SEC, OR ANOTHER REGULATORY
AUTHORITY, REFEREUM AND PARTICIPANTS IN THE RFR TOKEN SALE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL OR CRIMINAL
PENALTIES IF THE TOKENS ARE NOT PROPERLY REGISTERED. AS SUCH, PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD
MAKE THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS AND EVALUATIONS OF REFEREUM, INCLUDING THE MERITS AND RISKS
INVOLVED IN PURCHASING RFR TOKENS. IN COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAWS,
PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS LOCATED IN, UNDER THE CONTROL OF, OR A NATIONAL OR RESIDENT OF ANY
RESTRICTED LOCATION OR COUNTRY TO WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS EMBARGOED GOODS OR SERVICES,
ARE PROHIBITED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE TOKEN SALE. RESTRICTED LOCATIONS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT
LIMITED TO, CUBA, THE CRIMEA REGION OF UKRAINE, IRAN, LEBANON, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, SOMALIA, SUDAN,
AND SYRIA. AS SUCH, THIS WHITE PAPER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO SELL, OR ASOLICITATION OF
AN OFFER TO BUY, RFR TOKENS IN ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH IT IS UNLAWFUL TO MAKE SUCH AN OFFER
OR SOLICITATION AND IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. REFEREUM SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION
TO ISSUE ANY TOKENS TO ANY PERSON WHO IS A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE ISSUANCE
OF TOKENS TO HIM/HER/IT WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF LAW. REFEREUM RETAINS THE SOLE RIGHT,
IN ITS COMPLETE DISCRETION, TO ACCEPT OR REJECT TOKEN SALE PURCHASES, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FOR
ANY REASON. ANY REJECTED TRANSACTION SHALL BE REFUNDED. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS
WHITE PAPER WAS CREATED BY REFEREUM FROM ITS OWN INTERNAL RECORDS AND FROM PUBLISHED AND
UNPUBLISHED SOURCES IT BELIEVES TO BE RELIABLE. NEITHER THIS WHITE PAPER NOR ANY SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA PURPORTS TO BE INCLUSIVE, AND, ACCORDINGLY, EACH PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER IS EXPECTED TO
CONDUCT HIS/HER/ITS OWN “DUE DILIGENCE” AND RELY ON HIS/HER/ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVES. NEITHER
REFEREUM, NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, ADVISORS, OR AGENTS, MAKE ANY

PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER SHOULD CONSULT WITH HIS/HER/ITS OWN LEGAL, TAX, ACCOUNTING, AND OTHER
ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS, BURDENS, AND OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A
PURCHASE.
IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ANY PERSONS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TOKEN SALE DESCRIBED IN THIS
