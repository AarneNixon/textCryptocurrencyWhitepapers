2. Overview
This document outlines a new methodology for using the advances in technology for
decentralised transactions pioneered by Bitcoin and other crypto currencies to implement a
truly peer-to-peer decentralised sports betting protocol. The proposed protocol will be opensourced and it is anticipated over time that numerous disparate software interfaces will be
built (much as there are many flavours of Bitcoin wallet today) all using the common protocol
with its underlying crypto currency.

2.1 Marketplace
The global regulated and unregulated gambling market is forecast to reach $533 billion by
the end of 2017 with sports betting the highest contributor. That represents a 47% increase
from the $363 billion market figure a decade earlier in 2007 according to Global Betting and
Gaming Consultants1.
The Global online sports betting market is valued at $205 billion as reported by Statista and
the gross gambling yield of the regulated global football betting market alone is expected to
reach $80 billion2.
According to Technavio, the global market for online gambling has increased at a significant
growth rate over the years 2010 to 2016 and projections are made that the market would
maintain growth rates over the next five years. This growth has been forecast taking into
consideration the previous growth patterns, the growth drivers and the current and future
trends. One of which being large sporting events such as the upcoming FIFA World Cup
2018 in Russia as well as many other major sports events that take place around the world3.
$3-trillion - the value of the global sports betting market according to a UN conference on
crime. However, the vast majority of that is generated by unregulated gambling4.
In a report from Global and Gaming Consultants, Asia is the biggest market for gambling
and sports betting in particular. It has grown at a consistent rate to more than $40 billion. In
China, up to $1-billion can be gambled on a single game of football. It is estimated that there
is an unregulated sports betting market of around $180 billion per annum in China alone and
$60 billion annually in India predominantly through cricket5.
Ultimately, sports betting has become the fastest growing market segment within online
gambling worldwide. We believe that the online sports betting market offers opportunities for
coin usage that far exceeds many other ICOs currently offered. Our goal is to become the
number 1 platform for crypto-currency gamblers to bet on sports.

2.2 The Problem
The online betting industry has lacked innovative ideas for some time. Odds are massively in
favour of the bookmaker, payment methods are outdated and regularly winning players are
restricted or banned. There is a lack of security, lack of privacy, extortionate fees and low
returns, all of which are factors which either put bettors off or drive them to underground
betting.

2.3 The Solution - Why BETR Betting is better
BETR is different. It is the betting crypto-currency that will establish truly decentralised sports
betting on the internet. With BETR providing financial security true peer-to-peer betting
becomes possible on the internet with entities that have no prior relationship. Using
blockchain we are able to provide sportsbook clients that operate with no human or business
entity in the middle. The system is safe, the software and transactions are provably fair and
robust. Add on the ease of paying for a bet through BETR currency and the fact that you can
make larger bets, and you can see why BETR Betting is the future of betting.

2.4 Competitive Landscape
There are several other sports betting operations that operate in the crypto space but we
differ in one significant respect – we take no percentage of wagers and no margin. We purely
facilitate a peer-to-peer bet. Add to that a team of seasoned veterans with a wealth of
knowledge in the online betting industry and the result is a robust solution designed by the
industry to work with the industry.
Competitive Sports Betting products include: Decentbet, Wagerr, Betmaster, Betrium,
Imperium, Tombet, Fansunite, Quickbetcoin and Ethersport.

2.5 Risks
There are a number of risks inherent in the proposed solution:
•
•

•
•

We may not raise the minimum amount or may decide to cancel the ICO because of
changes in the market place. In this scenario all pre-ICO funds will be returned in full
The token may not be performant on the Ethereum network under load. While we
have mitigated this to some extent by removing much of the high speed data transfer
from the blockchain this remains a risk and may require us to move our technology to
one of the newer blockchains such as EOS.
We may have regulatory pressure to impose jurisdictional or other controls on token
usage – in practice this is not possible and would translate into pressure to prevent
trading of the tokens
Exchanges may resist listing the tokens because of the gambling nature of the utility

4

•

•

We may have difficulty providing the truly distributed directory in a performant waythis is an ongoing development and the team has a deep experience of similar
products – we are confident that we will find solutions but there may be compromises
on the distributed nature of the directory in early versions
We are reliant on a public blockchain (Ethereum) to provide the underlying
transaction mechanism which may become too slow or expensive to be practical.
Ultimately much of our technology is not reliant on blockchain and we would be able
to move to a competing blockchain such as EOS relatively easily (some of these such
as EOS are not yet in production)

3. Elements of an Online Sportsbook
A sports book comprises several discrete components:
Bets are found using a user interface that is logically laid out and based on an underlying
sports hierarchy. Sports have Leagues (sometimes divided by country/region) and leagues
have events. Events have markets which are groups of selections that together make up a
bet offering.
Every selection (eg. Chelsea to win against Arsenal) has a price at which someone –
traditionally a bookmaker – is prepared to lay the bet. A bet can either be laid or bet – on an
exchange users can take either side of a bet – they can lay it or bet it. Using the example
above, the lay bet for Chelsea to win would be Arsenal to win or the event to end in a draw.
Typically, a bet includes an element of margin which is the amount that the bookmaker
retains as his profit. In an exchange model a percentage is deducted from the winning to
provide margin to the exchange.
When a bet is placed an amount is agreed between the Bettor (the person making the bet)
and the layor (the party who is offering to take the bet) and then funds from either side are
escrowed until the underlying event has been resulted, at which point the bet (less any fees)
is settled in favour of the winner.
While all of the above functionality can be encapsulated in a single exchange (such as
Betfair) or sportsbook (such as SkyBet), the model described in this white paper eliminates
the requirement for these intermediaries – opening the door to unlimited, fee free, betting.

4. A Distributed Peer to Peer Model
This document presents a variation on the traditional sportsbook and exchange model. By
eliminating the “middle man” – essentially the escrow agent – using technology now freely
available through the blockchain we can build sportsbook clients that operate with no human
or business entity in the middle between betting pairs.

4.1 Mechanism
The betting process is broken into several discrete software components with defined APIs
for interaction between them. All bets are stored on the Ethereum blockchain which provides
transparency and provable fairness on the transactions. More importantly it provides a way
for 2 parties who don’t know each other and have no common account holder to bet with one
another.

5

4.2 Benefits
The benefits of the distributed model are numerous.

4.2.1 Peer to Peer betting with no central party
By providing a robust escrow and settlement service between 2 parties who do not know one
another and have no common operator the system provides access to betting opportunities
that did not previously exist.

4.2.2 Applicability to other activities
A transaction does not have to comprise a bet – the same system can be used for any
activity where funds are escrowed prior to a result and then settled to the winner (eg. A game
of poker) although we will focus on betting initially

4.2.3 Open source systems
Ultimately the software and standards that comprise the system will be open source and free
for anyone to copy and use.

4.2.4 Access to much larger bets – the wholesale angle
There is a massive market for betting where the amounts exceed those that individual
operators are prepared to risk. This system will provide the liquidity to enable these bets to
be placed – there are no system limits. Bets are pooled so many parties can match a single
bet.

4.2.5 Provably fair and unbreakable
The software and transactions are provably fair and robust. Punters need to know that they
will be paid their winnings – no questions asked!

4.2.6 No risk to punters from underfunded operators
Punters have no risk of operators or layors who have insufficient funds to lay their bets – in
this system all bets are prefunded on both sides.

4.2.7 Ease of funding for bet placement
No more credit cards, wire transfers and other outdated payment mechanisms. BETR
(Betting coins) are ERC20 compliant coins and will trade on major crypto exchanges and can
always be bought and sold against coins such as bitcoin and ethereum.

4.2.8 Instant access to winnings
Winnings are distributed as soon as a bet is resulted and available in instant crypto funds for
use as the owner sees fit.

6

5. Components of a Distributed Model
5.1 Escrow and Resulting/Settlement
Placing a bet with another party entails two important functions. The first is to hold funds
from the time that a bet is made until it is settled. The second is settlement in favour of the
winner (assuming there is one – refunds to both parties in the event of a tie or cancellation).
The latter poses a problem. Any system that is automated would have to have a robust and
agreed resulting system that is immune to human or system error.
We intend to cater for a number of different resulting systems – the differences being simply
how the winner is determined.
By using this mechanism there is no requirement for the token to have any understanding of
the underlying event or bet.

5.1.1 Layor
Bets may be offered with either party able to agree on the result. In the case of sportsbooks
or exchanges linking to the system it is quite likely that they would set settlement to be at the
discretion of the layor (Sportsbook) as that is how they operate today. Initially this may be
the bulk of the bets.

5.1.2 Consensus
In the same way that the blockchain is kept inherently honest by all parties agreeing,
settlement could be according to the majority. On any bet due for settlement, once settlement
of layor resulted bets has occurred there would likely be sufficient evidence that the result is
correct triggering a consensus resulting. Protection would have to be incorporated to deal
with low liquidity markets, with a varying set of rules depending on the number and size of
bets.
Note that, given that the bets are all public record on the blockchain, resulting claims are not
limited to the parties who hold the specific bet. Consensus can be reached across all bets
on the same selection across the network and resulting decisions made network wide.

5.1.3 3rd party settlement
An interface will be provided for 3rd parties to provide resulting and arbitration. There could
be a fee associated with this service.

5.2 Authentication
While parties may remain anonymous it is intended that this system can also be integrated
with existing sports books or exchanges. In this scenario placing a bet may require an
account at the counterparty – bets that are offered may be flagged as requiring an account
and authentication.
The protocol will ultimately incorporate a distributed authentication mechanism to facilitate
the offering of bets by entities that require player accounts

7

5.3 The Better Betting Node
It is no use having a betting system if the users cannot find the bet that they want. Not only
that, for the system to present sufficient liquidity, and to provide optimal volume for
consensus settlement, it is important that all nodes see the same selections as the same
thing. As an example, it is equally valid to call a match winner market “match winner” or
“winner” or even “moneyline 1X2”. The system will aim to provide a mechanism to avoid
duplication of markets and present a unified interface between disparate parties.
A distributed directory of sporting events, markets and selections will be incorporated in the
system making it simple for software clients to present a logically ordered menu of choices.
The system will combine the many “standards” for event and market naming so that the
same bet is treated equally regardless of the source.
This presents two distinct advantages to the overall ecology. In the first instance, it makes it
easy to find any specific bet. Secondly, and very importantly it makes it possible for bets to
be standardised and pooled together.
By ensuring that anyone wishing to offer a specific bet uses a common registry we are able
to increase the reliability of the consensus, and also to combine liquidity into a pool so bets
are not simply one on one.
So (as an example) assume I want to lay the Chelsea to win bet for this weekend’s premier
league fixture. I decide I am prepared to lay $1000. Someone else also wishes to lay
$1000. There is now $2000 available for anyone wishing to back Chelsea. The user would
see a unified interface – disparate layors are agreeing on the identification of the same bet
and their liquidity combined. As a punter I can come in and back Chelsea to win for $1500
and this would be shared across both layors – as two separate transactions.
The more entities on either side of the bet that exist the better consensus settlement will
work.

5.4 Different views based on target market
While the API will provide all functionality to all participants it is anticipated that there would
be more specific apps built that focus on the intended end user. As an example, a sports
bettor would in general use an interface similar to modern sports betting apps where bets
can easily be found and taken with no concern for the underlying markets and events or
laying prices.
Sportsbooks and wholesale bettors would utilise the lay side of bets. Some implementation
of directory services and lay pricing may be purely API level integrations with existing sports
books or exchanges.

5.5 Better Betting Node Software
Core to the system is software that implements this distributed directory and places bets as
contracts onto the blockchain. This software is called the Better Betting Node (BBN). Similar
to miners in a blockchain system the BBN acts as a distributed mirror for directories,
facilitating a standard repository for sporting information that can be added to from any agent
on the network, and queried in order to present user friendly client interfaces to punters.
Anyone will be able to implement a BBN using open source code. There are no limits on the
number of nodes and no one node is in control of the network. The Company will establish
some initial nodes to present an initial sporting offer which can be amended and contributed
to by other nodes.
8

A node has the following high level feature sets:

5.5.1 Transaction confirmation
Every transaction, whether placing or resulting a bet is confirmed and stored on the
Etheruem blockchain. The process of placing and resulting (which triggers settlement) is
controlled through the node.

5.5.2 Directory Service
Acting as a mirror service, nodes facilitate a coordinated, consistent distributed directory
service. It is this key building block that enables bets on the same selection to be pooled,
both for aggregate betting and for consensus settlement. The more bets that are placed on
any single selection the more robust the system becomes. Nodes also propagate bids and
offers to all clients, facilitating the matching of Bettors and layors.

5.5.3 Synchronisation Services
Nodes automatically synch with all other nodes providing low latency updates to betting
offers and consistent offering across the network

5.5.4 Automated APIs for bet offers
Nodes expose APIs for all functionality allowing server to server integration between existing
bookmaker servers and the network.

6. Technical Implementation
6.1 Overview
The Better Betting Foundation depends on an effective technical implementation to reach its
intended goal of providing a Global Betting Liquidity Pool.
Alongside the evolving business requirements, a technical investigation has been taking
place with the intention of finding the optimal technical solution.
Fundamentally, the intention is to provide a global betting liquidity pool for use by bet market
creators and bettors. In principal, anyone can create a Bet Offer based on real sports events,
this is more traditionally known as laying a bet. Each Bet Offer will be grouped by market and
event and listed in a searchable directory. Bettors wishing to place a bet can then search the
directory and locate the bet they want.
The betting acceptance process then involves the Ethereum blockchain to store the agreed
bets contracts which also holds the stake and liability in escrow – the system will use our
own issued betting tokens (BETR).
When the events are over, the bets related to that event can be settled. In order to settle a
bet, the result of that selection must be determined. The bet smart contracts will contain
information as to the party that will supply resulting for the selection. In the case of bets
offered by sportsbooks this will generally be the Bet Offer Creator (the layor of the bet).
Other solutions are to appoint a 3rd party to result (this could be a data feed) or to appoint a
9

special 3rd party which is the consensus node – this node would settle according to a set of
rules based on all other settlements of the same selection.
On settlement, the contracts are notified and either the bet stake is transferred to the Bet
Offer creator or the liability is transferred to the Bettor. In the case of a push or refund, then
the stake is returned to the bettor and the liability is returned to the Bet Offer creator.

6.2 One Application and Two Linked Systems
The bet offer system needs to scale and to offer low latency price and offer updates to the
bettors. We believe that the optimal architecture is to create a Hybrid system combining the
power and transactional integrity brought by blockchain (while acknowledging existing issues
such as speed and scalability and gas cost of transactions) with the superior processing
power and low latency that can be derived from a peer-to-peer non-transactional system.
The Ethereum network will be used for the management of the bet contracts and the BETR
tokens and interface to another system on top of that to provide a UX for the Bet Offer
creators and Bettors by running the betting directory services as a distributed database. This
system we call the ‘Better Betting Node’ (BBN).

The BBN is a downloadable application which is installed on the user’s device and
incorporates an ethereum wallet. It is similar to a blockchain application in so far as it
operates without central servers and the nodes communicate with each other to maintain the
state of the database. BBN does not need to store data indefinitely, and that is one aspect
that sets it apart from standard blockchain networks where every node (or miner) stores a
complete copy of the transaction ledger.
By creating the BBN to be meet the precise technical requirements of the Bet Creators, the
Bettors and API clients, the application will be fast and will not have 3rd party costs to run. In
its interface with Ethereum for creating and resulting bet contracts, the BBN will restrict the
Ethereum costs to a minimum whilst still maintaining the decentralized nature of the
application.

6.3 How it Works for All
There are two parties to a bet. In our terms we call the party that creates (or lays) a Bet Offer
10

a BET CREATOR. Traditionally this would be a sportsbook but in our case, anyone can be a
Bet Creator. On the other side, the party that takes the bet offer (or a part of it) is called the
BETTOR.
From the Bettors point of view, they fundamentally would like to see a list of sporting events
and the bet options with odds and limits that are available. By selecting a bet option and
applying a stake amount, the bet can be created.
For the Bet CREATOR, they want to be able to set up a series of Bet Offers with bet options,
odds and limits (maximum risk exposure) and place them onto the bet directory so that the
Bettors can then select them as above. It is envisaged that a standard BBN API will be
created that will enable the Bet Creators to integrate directly with their own systems so
providing automatic bet offer creation.
Above all this the system needs to know when the sporting events are scheduled and when
they are resulted. To do this the same API that is available to sports books can be used to
link instances of BBN and data feed providers. This will facilitate automated event, market
and selection creation and may also facilitate resulting. One of the key features of the
directory will be to provide Event, Market and Selection IDs so that the event data can be
cross matched with the bet creators systems. The Event IDs will include major Data Feed
Provider’s IDs and may also include Bet Creators IDs.

6.4 BBN Close-up
While there is a more comprehensive set of technical use case requirements, the summary
below gives an indication of how the system will function:
1. BBN provides a distributed bet information database which is referred to as the
Distributed Directory. In essence, the application maintains a local database on the
client’s device and keeps it in sync with the Distributed Directories on all the other
BBN devices in the network.
2. The size of the Distributed Directory needs to be kept small, not only so that it is
fast but also so that the BBN application can ultimately run on mobile devices with
smaller storage availability.
3. To maintain the Distributed Directory, data changes must be transmitted to other
BBNs so that they all maintain the same data throughout the network.
4. The BBN application will provide a user interface so that the Bet Offer Creators and
Bettors can interact with the Distributed Directory.
5. Bet Creators will at least the following functions available:
a. Create Bet Offer with options, odds and limits. The Bet Offers total exposure (the
limit) must be covered by sufficient BETR tokens which will be escrowed when the
bets are placed – the system must have sufficient funds to pay out if the bettor
wins.
b. Remove Bet Offer – remove it from the market
c. Edit Bet Offer – Options, odds and limits can be edited
d. List accepted bets – this requirement means that when the bets are accepted on
Ethereum, the contract addresses are transmitted back to BBN which then stores
them for later reference.
6. The Bettors need to be able to:
a. Find the events and bets they are interested in. Navigation is part of event
information (sport, country, league etc).
b. Select the bet and enter the amount of stake (in BETR tokens) they wish to bet.
c. BBN will accept a bet if the Bettor has sufficient funds and the bet is still
available.
7. Ethereum will manage the bets in the form of contracts.

11

a. On acceptance BBN will transmit the bet in the form of a contract definition
to Ethereum. If this is the first bet taken of the Bet Creators Bet Offer then BBN
will tell Ethereum to create a new Bet Offer Master Contract, if not then the
existing Master Contract will be updated. The funds from both sides will be
escrowed by debiting the required BETR tokens from their Ethereum addresses
and transferred to the bet contract. Contract addresses will be transmitted back to
BBN which will update the Bet Offer in the Directory.
b. On Settlement, the bet contract will be settled by the resultor. The win or stake
(depending on who wins) will be transferred to the correct party. The Master
Contract and the Bet contracts for that bet offer will then be closed – destroyed.

6.5 BBN’s Three-Layered Structure
To provide a technical solution for these requirements, a three-layered application is
envisaged which can be described as follows:

User Interface
Web Services

API Services

BBN DD
BBN Local Database

Ethereum I/F
Ethereum Ledger(lite)

Net
BBN DD Net

Ethereum Net

The highest level is the user interface which is in essence a standard browser encapsulated
within the application. Use of modern web app coding practises makes this an optimal way to
deliver the user experience.
The User Interface will communicate with a mini-webserver within the BBN application. The
webserver will be responsible for generating pages and data connections and receiving
responses from the User Interface layer.
Note that more scalable nodes can also be produced to serve as web servers for a server
based wallet.
Also delivered from the mini-webserver are API services which provide a common method of
access to the Web Server functions as well as all other external interactions to systems such
as data feed providers and Sportsbooks.
The API Services layer will also be responsible for the interaction with the BBN DD which is
12

the distributed database and the Ethereum Network.
The betting protocol (placing and settling of bets) will be implemented as smart contracts on
the Ethereum network. While this is the core of the system – in fact a large amount of the
functionality will be in the Better Betting Nodes – the distributed betting directory nodes. Due
to the latency, performance and cost issues on Ethereum, BBN will coexist on a proprietary
distributed system and be built to incorporate the Ethereum functionality. A BBN client will
incorporate both its own proprietary fast protocol for the betting offer and also the Ethereum
protocols for bet placement and settlement.

7. The ICO
The system will be funded through the issuing of a betting token (BETR). BETR will be
capped in terms of the total number of tokens that can exist and will be issued according to
the following schedule:

Amount to be
Raised

Terms

Min $2M

There will be an early bird bonus system built into
the ICO. No more than $30M will be raised.
Within 2 weeks of the ICO end date tokens will be
issued and become available for trading.

Max $30M

Tokens issued to founders will be released in 4
equal tranches 3 months apart with the first
tranche being on the initial ICO date.
A tiered bonus system will be built in to
incentivise early investment. Up to
•
•
•
•
•

$1M : 125% tokens
$2M : 120% tokens
$3M : 115% tokens
$4M : 110% tokens
$5M : 105% tokens

Thereafter tokens will be issued at ICO value
ICO token value is set to US$0.10c per token – to
be priced in ETH and BTC at an exchange rate at
the time of ICO.
24% of tokens issued will be to founders and the
team.
7% of tokens issued will be for advisors and
bounty.
5% of tokens were sold to early stage investors
There is a hard cap of 650M tokens

We will seek to list BETR on as many crypto exchanges as possible, making interchange
seamless and priced according to market prices. So, as an example, the initial issue may be
limited to $50M worth of coins at the time of issue. In the event that there is $500M in play at
any one time, the price of each coin will have to increase from 10c to $1 in order to
13

accommodate the increased volume.
Usage of the coins is fundamental to any ICO – we believe that the betting market offers
opportunities for coin usage that far exceeds many other ICOs currently being offered.

7.1 Foundation establishment and governance
Better Betting Foundation has been established in Estonia (Better Betting Sihtasutus –
90014075). It has been funded privately for the initial establishment and to provide
marketing and technical resources to proceed to the ICO.
The Company is not for profit and has no beneficiaries. Its purpose is to develop and make
available the software systems to enable distributed sports betting on the blockchain.
The Company was founded by Adriaan Brink and David Vanrenen. Supervisory board
members are David Vanrenen, Hilly Ehrlich and Mitchell Rankin. Management board is
Adriaan Brink.

7.2 ICO and token sale
A minimum $2M, maximum $30M will be raised through issuing of tokens. These funds will
be used for
•
•
•
•

Development and release of the better betting protocol
Development and open-sourcing of dapps and node software
Marketing to key stakeholders and consumers
Legal and administrative costs

7.3 Hard Cap
There is a hard cap of 650M tokens to be produced. In the event that the token sale does
not raise sufficient funds the hard cap may be reduced.

7.4 Reserve for future issue
An additional reserve fund of tokens will be created in the initial token event to be sold on the
market at the discretion of the Company. This reserve fund will be no more than 10% of the
total amount issued at the ICO and will be held in trust and not released for at least 12
months. No further tokens will be created apart from the ongoing maintenance tokens.

7.5 Ongoing Maintenance Tokens
Ongoing maintenance tokens will be created periodically by the Company and sold on the
market to replenish tokens that are burnt as part of transaction fees. Transaction fees will be
based on the underlying gas price consumed by the transaction and will be fixed per
transaction regardless of the amount of the bet.
