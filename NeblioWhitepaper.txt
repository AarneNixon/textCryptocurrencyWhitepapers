Abstract
Blockchain’s unique distributed ledger technology is what makes the
Neblio Network possible. This decentralized system of securely
storing transactions is the future of database technology for global
networks. Enterprise applications taking advantage of this
technology gain numerous benefits over those using traditional
database architectures including transaction immutability,
transparency, security, reliability, and decentralization.
Despite the maturity of blockchain networks, few
applications have taken advantage of the technology
due to the difficulty, and cost of integration
and maintenance. Unlike legacy
blockchain networks, next-generation
blockchain networks such as
Neblio will fill the huge
gap in the enterprise
market to simplify
the development
and deployment
of distributed
applications that
drive business
value through
blockchain
technology.

Blockchain

What is the Neblio Blockchain?
A blockchain network such as Neblio is a decentralized
peer-to-peer network of nodes that exchange
information in the form of transactions; storing those
transactions in an immutable distributed ledger. All
nodes have a full copy of the ledger (known as the
blockchain, due to being made of individual blocks) at
all times. A node that would like to record information in
the ledger first broadcasts a transaction containing the
information to the network where it is relayed to all other
nodes. One node then compiles all new available
transactions on the network into a block that is added to
the blockchain. Once a block is stored on the
blockchain, it and all of the transactions contained within
it are immutable, meaning that the transactions cannot
ever be altered in any way. When information on the
ledger needs to be updated, as common with database
systems, a new transaction is simply added to the ledger
with the new information. However, the original
information that was stored in the ledger remains intact
and verifiable in a previous block for the entire life of the
blockchain.
Building on top of this blockchain technology originally
created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto for
Bitcoin, the Neblio Blockchain provides distinct
advantages for business and enterprise use cases for
which bitcoin was not intended.

Enterprise Adoption & Next
Generation Solutions
Despite ever-increasing media coverage of Bitcoin and other
blockchain-related technologies, along with countless articles
counting the industries that blockchain technology will revolutionize
each year (for the last 5 years!) there has been very little adoption of
blockchain technology in the enterprise space. Industries that would
benefit the most from the inherent advantages the blockchain provides over traditional database architectures are waiting for mature
toolsets, developer ecosystems, and packaged platforms to easily
develop and deploy new applications, or to move traditional
applications off of legacy database architectures and on to a
blockchain network.

Blockchain

While legacy blockchain networks have gained popularity by
focusing on the digital transfer of value (cryptocurrency),
next-generation blockchain solutions will focus on how the
underlying technology can be evolved to support new use cases
through innovation. While these next-generation solutions will also
support the transfer of value due to the fundamental need of
transferable “tokens” on the network, the focus will be on enabling
new technology and use cases. In the case of Neblio, enabling
businesses and enterprise developers to harness an intuitive
blockchain platform and developer ecosystem to rapidly develop and
deploy decentralized applications that utilize distributed ledger
technology instead of traditional database architectures.

Distributed
Applications
What are distributed applications?
In the blockchain sense, distributed applications are applications that access and store
pieces of information on the Neblio blockchain. These applications typically have a
“front-end” client that stores, processes, or displays the data for the application.
As an example, consider a theoretical medical application running on an iPad. In a
traditional enterprise world, this application would store and retrieve patient medical
records from a central database located in the medical office. Doctors can use the
application as they visit patients to view and update medical records. But…
What if this medical office is part of a larger network of medical offices that share
patient records or part of a state-wide hospital network?
How do we ensure that the medical records stored in the database are always up
to date in all locations and cannot ever be altered or lost?
What if the database becomes corrupt or is lost due to disaster or hardware
failure? Do we have backups? If so, are the backups recent and will the backup
restore be successful?
How much downtime will a disaster cause? Will we have to cancel patient
appointments and lose revenue?
The answer is a distributed application. Imagine the same application, but instead of
using a traditional database, the application accesses and stores the medical records in
real-time on a private (due to medical record privacy laws) Neblio blockchain network.
Each office or hospital in the network runs a private version of the Neblio blockchain
node which ensures that every single record stored in the ledger is accurate and
immutable across the entire network in real time. Nodes can be lost due to disaster or
downtime without a single record being lost or altered and the network stays up. The
main office can now use a separate distributed application that uses the same data off
of the blockchain, but in a different way, to begin processing insurance claims and other
paperwork as soon as doctors at a distant branch office are done adding patient
records. This is just one example, in a single industry, where a distributed application
built on the Neblio blockchain could provide immediate business value, driving
efficiency and lowering costs.

The Neblio
Next Generation
Blockchain
Platform
Introduction
The Neblio Blockchain Platform
is a development platform built
to simplify and accelerate the
development and deployment
of distributed applications on
the Neblio Blockchain, and
potentially other blockchain
networks in the future.
Difficulty and inadequate
developer skillsets are seen as
the major obstacles inhibiting
the adoption of blockchain
technology for developing
distributed applications in the
enterprise and business worlds.
To overcome these obstacles,
the Neblio Platform is built from
the start for enterprise
distributed application
development. A suite of
RESTful APIs, in almost all of
today’s popular programming
languages, will allow developers
to intuitively interact with the

Neblio blockchain network
without having to know the
complex details of blockchain
technology. Developers that are
familiar with using RESTful APIs
to interact with today’s
traditional databases will feel
right at home developing apps
that instead use the Neblio
Blockchain to access and store
information.
Deploying a new Neblio node to
support your app on the
Neblio Network will be as easy
as launching a Docker
container. In industries where
an application or group of
applications may need to run
on a private blockchain, Neblio’s
open source nature, along with
our Business Services, mean
that private deployments can be
quick and painless.

Tokens
Tokens on a blockchain network incentivize network users to secure
and operate the network. In a public blockchain network, bad actors can
attempt to attack or disrupt the network for their own gain. In an effort
to secure the network against such attacks, the network must have a
method of finding consensus. Traditional networks such as Bitcoin use an
energy and computation-heavy method of finding consensus known as
proof-of-work. Users are rewarded with bitcoins for using their
computational power to verify new blocks for the block chain and
consensus is found when the majority of the computational power on the
network agrees, preventing attacks. In contrast, many newer
blockchain networks, along with Neblio use a proof-of-stake consensus
model. Proof-of-stake works by using the network users’ tokens as votes
towards consensus to verify new blocks and secure the network. Users
with more tokens get more votes since they have more tokens to lose
if an attack on the network is successful. In order to incentivize users
to stake their tokens in this model, users are given a reward for staking
their tokens and verifying new blocks.
Whether proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, tokens play an essential role in
the operation of a public blockchain network’s consensus model. Tokens
must have some value to incentivize users to participate in securing the
network. The Neblio token, NEBL, allows Neblio users to exchange NEBL
with other Neblio users while encouraging users via token rewards to
stake and help secure the network.



Note: Neblio Tokens (NEBL) are not an investment
vehicle of any kind and do not pertain in any way to an offering of
securities in any jurisdiction. Ownership of NEBL carries no rights express
or implied. Participants should have no expectation of influence over
governance of Neblio. NEBL tokens are only valuable in the sense that they
are required to create, distribute, and use distributed applications on the
Neblio blockchain network and can be transferred amongst Neblio users.

The Neblio Next Generation Blockchain Platform

Simplification as an Enterprise
Adoption Driver
Difficulty deploying blockchain networks, developing distributed
applications, and packaging the two into something that can be
operated internally or by customers externally is the most
significant obstacle slowing the adoption of this technology in
the enterprise and business world. By providing single API calls
to instantly deploy a full Neblio Node, developers will have an
easy way to spin up or spin down a local testbed that is
directly connected to the global Neblio Network; allowing for
rapid agile-style development of distributed applications. All
Neblio APIs will be designed with simplicity as the priority.
Enterprise application developers that are used to working with
traditional database RESTful interfaces will be able to create
new, or adapt old, applications to use the Neblio
blockchain to store or access information without knowing
complex blockchain details, due to the similarity in API design.
Wherever possible, unnecessary blockchain and network details
will be hidden from the developer, with the APIs instead
exposing only the interfaces needed to develop or deploy
scalable distributed applications.
Along with APIs to provision Neblio nodes and interact with the
blockchain, developers must have a simple way to package and
deploy their distributed applications and services in a way that
is repeatable, maintainable, and reliable. Where necessary, the
Neblio Platform should allow a method for distributed
applications to be able to discover the appropriate Neblio node
to use for communication with the network to improve
performance and availability. If an appropriate node does not
exist, applications should be able to provision Neblio nodes
themselves that will become part of the network. Applications
should have the ability to monitor the health of the network
and deploy new nodes in the event nodes lose connectivity or
go down, in an effort prevent network outages and maintain
enterprise reliability and availability.

The Neblio Next Generation Blockchain Platform

Security & Immutability
The blockchain technology at the foundation of the Neblio
network affords distributed applications running on the
network inherent security advantages. Due to the
decentralized nature of the public Neblio network and the
proof-of-stake consensus model where users of the Neblio
network are incentivized to run a Neblio node and secure the
network, successful attacks on the network by bad actors are
nearly impossible. The greater the number of wallets currently
staking tokens, the more secure the network is from attacks.
On private Neblio networks where there are not a large
number of users securing the network via staking, Neblio
tokens are staked by trusted parties that set up the private
network. This allows for private Neblio networks to be as
trustworthy as the trusted parties in charge of operating them,
while retaining the many other inherent benefits of blockchain
technology on the network.
Unlike traditional database architectures, distributed
applications storing and accessing information on the Neblio
blockchain can be certain that that information has not be
changed since it was stored. This allows for distinct
advantages in use cases in records management,
auditing, and lifecycle verification. Information
is always stored on the blockchain via additions,
rather than modifying existing data. Distributed
applications can choose to view the latest
version of information via accessing the
information at the highest block height for
which it exists, or viewing every single
transaction in which the information resides.

Scalability & Reliability

The Neblio network’s massive scalability and reliability through
resiliency make it a perfect fit for enterprise and business
customers to run Tier 1 applications vital to their day to day
business needs. Through decentralized mesh networking,
Neblio nodes connect to each other relaying blocks around the
globe. Every functional node contains an entire copy of the
Neblio blockchain at all times, increasing the performance of
potential distributed applications since they can choose to
interact with the closest or fastest node. This scalability in a
global sense can drastically improve application performance
and response time while ensuring the information on the
blockchain can be accessed nearly anywhere the application is
running.
The global scale of the Neblio network also provides
enterprise-level reliability through resiliency. Nodes are able to
join and leave the network at will, whether it be by choice or due
to downtime, without harming the network. Applications that
are communicating with a node that leaves the network will simply begin communicating with another node that also has a full
copy of the blockchain. No matter which node the application is
interacting with, the result of storing or accessing information
will always be the same.

Use Cases

The Neblio Next Generation Blockchain Platform

Blockchain technology has a vast number of use cases in the business and enterprise
space. From distributed applications managing the secure records of financial transactions
in an immutable ledger that can be traced for audit purposes, to cloud-scale applications
managing the secure access and storage of the explosion of information generated by millions of internet-of-things devices. The Neblio blockchain network has the ability to drive
business value through revolutionizing the way that enterprises develop and deploy
applications in nearly every industry.

Neblio
Blockchain
APIs

Design Driven by
Simplification
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) must be
designed with a purpose in mind. In the case of Neblio,
our APIs are being designed for simplicity first. In an
effort to drive adoption of blockchain technology, our
goal is to break through the blockchain skillset
inefficiencies of the average developer and general
difficulty surrounding legacy blockchain APIs by
supplying a simplified abstraction layer API in a familiar
and easy to use format. Developers familiar with
existing RESTful APIs will feel at home using the Neblio
API Suite in the language of their choice to interact with
the Neblio blockchain network.

Language Support
The Neblio API suite will support the same set of uniform core
APIs in nearly all of today’s most popular programming
languages. Starting with:

Python
		Java
JS
		Node.Js
.NET (C# & VB.NET) 		Go
Objective-C
		PHP

14

RESTful Architecture Design
Underneath the language-specific libraries that will be used to
create distributed applications on the Neblio network will
reside a RESTful API layer. This API layer can be called directly
with raw HTTP requests or via one of the language-specific
libraries. Representational state transfer, or REST is an API style
used to provide interoperability between systems over a
network. A REST endpoint (Neblio node) listens for an
appropriate HTTP request that corresponds to an API, processes
the API call, then performs and action or returns data back to
the caller. Integrating a RESTful architecture into the Neblio core
node will bring the latest modern API architecture to the
blockchain, increasing interoperability with existing services,
ecosystems, and applications that are already using modern
RESTful APIs today.

Neblio Blockchain APIs

Enterprise-Driven Requirements
While designs for the Neblip API Suite v1 are already underway
and centered on simplicity, supportability, and usability, the
v2 of our API Suite will be designed around the feedback and
design requirements we receive from our users. We are open
to designing or implementing new APIs that meet the
requirements of our users. Whether an enterprise user, or an
individual launching their first distributed application on the
Neblio network, our requirements, features and releases will
be driven by the users, accelerating further innovation in the
simplification of developing and deploying distributed
applications.

Azure or hosted directly by Neblio. Neblio Business Services will support
custom node deployment and hosting options to meet every customer need.

Neblio Business Services

Private Blockchain Development
There are cases, such as in the healthcare application example
above, where a private Neblio blockchain network is more suited
for a user’s business need than the main, public Neblio network.
In these cases, customers have the option to deploy the private
Neblio network themselves utilizing our fully open source node
software and tools while tweaking it to their liking, or utilizing
Neblio Business Services to build the private Neblio network that
meets their business needs. In cases where information on the
blockchain must be encrypted for security, or where information
needs to be relayed from node to node in smaller blocks at a
faster cadence, customers can come to us to design the private
network they need and provide support in on an on-going basis.

17

Conclusion
The Neblio Platform will provide the fully open source APIs,
tools, and services needed by business and enterprises to
rapidly develop and deploy distributed applications.
Replacing legacy database applications with truly scalable and
reliable distributed applications through the development of
familiar and easy to use API abstraction layers is the goal of
the Neblio Platform. Blockchain technology has the potential
to revolutionize the way business operate in many industries.
Building solutions that radically reduce the difficulty and
simplify the complex barriers to entry
of blockchain technology will leave
Neblio strongly positioned to fill
a gap in the current market.
