Manifest
We are a team of discrete and algorithmic traders who launched our business
immediately prior to the mortgage crisis of 2008, and made a high return on our
investment during that period. Initially, we specialized in American shares. We now trade
shares, futures, options, currencies, and cryptocurrencies.
In 2009, we registered United Traders, a proprietary trading company, and proved
ourselves as high-quality investors specializing in the U.S. stock markets.
We know what a professional trader needs to be successful, and so we introduced
Aurora, an excellent multimarket platform, used to directly access U.S. stock exchanges
and other markets as well.
We developed a major finance-related Web portal in Russian. We trained tens of
thousands of people in trading and finance. We created hundreds of professional traders.
We opened our eyes to Russian financial authorities on the problem of binary options.
We are concerned about regulators who promote closed and complex markets, rather
than providing accessibility thereto and transparency thereof; investment banks, which
over the past 200 years have created barriers between companies and access to capital
market opportunities; and algorithmic funds, feeding on easy prey under the guise of
regulators. Moreover, we have many claims against the global economic system, which
contributes to wars and disparity.
We push for a crypto revolution in the global economy!

United Traders Today

Proprietary Trading Company
United Traders, a proprietary trading company, was incorporated in 2009 via a merger of
two teams of traders from Moscow and St. Petersburg, who previously had been engaged
by SwiftTrade (Canada) and Dimension trading (USA). At that time, both teams specialized
primarily in manual trading at NYSE and NASDAQ, involving U.S. shares.

As of October 2017, United Traders engages traders from 42 countries worldwide.
Various algorithms, including, but not limited to, high-frequency algorithms, are generally
employed in the trading business. The company is primarily focused on U.S. shares,
futures and options, although we do intensively tap into the European and Asian markets.

Software Developer
95% of traders engaged by United Traders use the company’s proprietary platforms.
A software package allows it to support the entire trading cycle, namely:
• Arche – a client application designed to trade on the NYSE and NASDAQ.
• Aurora – the company’s flagship. This is a multimarket platform (desktop windows)
which supports operations at the NYSE, NASDAQ, BATS, ARCA, CME, CBOE, CBOT,
EUREX, MOEX, SPBEX, Kraken and BTC-e (previously)
• Aurora manager – a platform which allows one to manage a group of traders, broker’s
clients, or several accounts held by a single asset manager. Access to this application
is granted upon request of any relevant proprietary group
• Trader’s account - a reporting tool used by traders who employ Arche, Aurora, Sterling
trader PRO, Laser trade, Fusion or Shiva

2

Investment Marketplace operated by United Traders
This marketplace was launched in 2012.
On October 17th, a conceptually new interface was released.
The following options are currently available to investors:
• Kvadrat Black - a pool of algorithmic strategies which was employed by the Kvadrat
Black SPC hedge fund (an audited report is available upon investor request). Currently,
this is one of the principal products on the platform designed by UT
• Type C strategy (UT Crypto fund) – a pool of manual and algorithmic strategies
extensively used on the cryptocurrency markets
• IPO with United Traders – a feature which allows investors to buy shares of companies
offering IPO’s on a provisional subscription basis, with an additional purchase
opportunity after expiration of a lock-up period (varying between 3 - 6 months)
• OTC - a feature which allows an investor to buy shares in non-public companies,
including, but not limited to, Space X, Slack, Airbnb, Uber, Palantir etc.

Training Platform
This is a one-month training session which covers the proprietary trading system, and
provides capital to all trainees.
It was developed for newbies, and is aimed at improving financial capabilities.

UT Magazine
An information and analytical portal that brings together traders and investors. The
financial dictionary has a special role to play here.

What Has It to Do with a Blockchain?
Projects described in this White Paper do not support blockchain technology or smart
contracts, and are aimed exclusively at developing a market of decentralized systems and
solutions.
The target audience, which long ago familiarized itself with cryptocurrencies and
blockchain technologies, has since Q2 2017 become keen on the development of
innovative decentralization, performance optimization, security improvement, and the
implementation of blockchain technologies as part of new projects.
United Traders believes that the discovery of the first category in the Theory of Inventive
Problem Solving (TIPS) is the primary benefit derived from blockchain technologies. All
other inventions will only contribute to this, and be deemed minor technologies. As such,
we may cease to develop our own blockchain technology, either approved by public
authorities or generating more transactions per time unit.
We believe that the main benefit of blockchain technologies could be in mature projects,
with the possibility of implementing smart contracts. Their properties open unlimited
possibilities for asset tokenization, which is being actively pursued by the cryptocurrency
community.
There are a significant number of opportunities to invest in physical goods, which at first
glance are not investment opportunities. These include art, old wine, hot rods, etc.
A smart contract affords an opportunity to invest similarly in services. Notably, the
investment projects listed above are not off-the-shelf products, and the market is not
scalable. We have a much broader view of the problem. A smart contract affords an
opportunity to invest similarly in services!
It is the service sector that is the potential environment for mass tokenization!
The lack of national, foreign exchange, and legal restrictions or barriers for venture
transactions is another benefit which is mandatory for implementation of our projects. For
a long time,venture investments have been bundled in national clusters of different
countries, and the main leader, of course, is Silicon Valley. Generally, venture funds which
operate as intermediaries for the benefit of major conglomerates are principal
beneficiaries of this. Such a market design is not efficient, and fails to promote human
progress on a global scale.
Blockchain technologies, and an upsurge of global business activities generated by the
same, is allowing the launch a global venture market today.

Ecosystems
OUR MISSION

Educate and innovate regardless of the global
economic situation. Act as an example and
financial guide for a new, smart generation,
striving for financial independence.
Communication Toolkit UT

Any major company operating in any industry worldwide is deemed a virtually closed
ecosystem. This allows companies to effectively respond to the most diverse needs of
customers.
We stick to this path as well, and seek to develop our own ecosystem. A user who is, or
intends to become, a financially competent person with various personal financial
planning needs, is the backbone of our system. He or she seeks to use every opportunity
available to invest capital and time in the most efficient manner.

5

A Problem of Credibility
There is a huge credibility problem for so-called "experts" in the world of finance and
investment. In this sense, expert means all those who make financial transactions, give
investment advice, and/or guarantee the trustworthiness of certain individuals and
organizations.
An entire industry of rating agencies has been created to resolve this problem. It involves
major investment banks making recommendations, audit companies certifying the
truthfulness of financial results, and/or the genuine nature of completed work.
However, these rating agencies do not resolve the problem entirely, due to lack of trust in
those who use their reputation to vouch for others. These are, for example, audit
companies.
Moreover, the problem is further aggravated by negative PR activity: articles of unverified
"experts" in the media, fictional awards, etc.
We offer a solution to this problem based on blockchain technology. All that needs to be
done is to track the actions of the relevant activities of the actors who are significant for the
reputation of a distributed register, which, in the future, would like to monetize or confirm
their reputation.
The following describes the components of the United Traders ecosystem that will form
the basis for a global expert ranking system.

6

Market Size and Potential
We consider the market for our products to be enormous, which is consistent with the volume of
transactions effected in foreign exchange for any and all countries worldwide, altogether. As
such, there is no need to specify values with a great number of zeros in this White Paper. We will
describe our market size assumptions in broad brushstrokes as follows:
The Investment Marketplace shall cover
• A private investment market, in terms of volumes of capital held by investors in
traditional products targeted at individuals, including: bank deposits, shares in mutual
funds, ETFs, etc.
• An ICO market, in terms of volumes of capital held by aggressive investors who
understand investments perfectly through tokens
• A venture investment market, in terms of increasing the attractiveness of investments in
start-ups, by providing access to private investors for top performing projects which
were previously accessible only to venture funds
• A small business lending market, in terms of volume, which may be converted into
investments through an ICO
• A P2P lending market, in terms of its social component, can be repeated in investments
through an ICO, based on the platform operated by United Traders.
We envision the following future for the cryptocurrency exchange
• The upside potential of any cryptocurrency exchange is limited by rules typical for the
volume of transactions involving any foreign exchange worldwide.
• We expect that development of crypto economy will result in substitution of leather
wallets and bank cards with electronic devices storing a great number of various token
names. Each wallet or eye retina (i.e. no device is required) holder will keep money in
his or her tokens representing the items used in his or her real life, irrespective of the
investment component.
• Thus, each exchange of goods or services will trigger that of tokens through a central
exchange token or without the same, as the case may be. A proper market place is
required to support the foregoing economic environment.
In terms of the Mega dictionary
A Wikipedia with authors who seek to derive profit where no altruism is possible. This is
like capitalism vs socialism. As such, a blockchain technology affords unlimited
opportunities to develop the advertising business, primarily through reliable feedback in
the form of payments by advertisers. The reader gets useful information from the
dictionary (advertising platform) and then buys the advertised product. Through a selfoptimizing system, the author who is the expert gets reliable feedback based on demand
for his work. This way the system will be endlessly filled with new, useful information.

Based on the reasoning of the possibilities of service tokenization and taking advantage
of the favorable market environment for our projects, we hold a Token sale.
Each project is described in more detail and in an old-fashioned manner in the following
three sections.

UT Investment Marketplace.
Project Profile

Page of an investment idea. Fragment

The concept of the Investment Marketplace by United Traders Project consists of the
development of an investment platform representing a venue, meeting place, or location,
where prospects for cooperation prospects are analyzed both by investors and business
representatives.
For purposes hereof, “business representatives” shall mean projects or companies of any
maturity, ranging from start-ups to major companies worldwide. Any user coming up with
his or her own investment idea need not be an official business representative.
However, an investment idea may be related, for instance, to a share purchase
transaction.
The policy pursued by UT Investment Marketplace provides a focus on private investors
holding small or medium-size capital resources. However, it does not mean that this
platform cannot be used by major companies or financial institutions.

Launched on October 17, 2010
https://unitedtraders.com/investments

My Investments page

Generally, UT Investment Marketplace is an online shop offering investment ideas on one
hand, and a venue for the presentation of ideas on the other. Each idea is made subject
to a detailed assessment by an expert community. Initially, this community is represented
by UT employees. Subsequently, the foregoing assessment is made by vote, which
involves the users themselves. High quality voting is guaranteed by having different
weights cast by various users. For purposes hereof, “weight” represents the user’s
experience, which is recorded in the blockchain.
At this point, a list of available investments includes strategies pursued by traders
engaged by United Traders at the stock and cryptocurrency markets. Moreover, ideas for
investments in shares for companies intending to initiate an IPO at a stock exchange,
private companies (OTC), or start-up tokens (ICO) will be included as well.

9

UT Investment Marketplace.
Action Plan
As of October 2017, the inner portion of the platform designed for investors has been
completed. However, it is expected to continue developing over time, so that users will
be able to offer their own investment ideas. In addition, a good share of work related to a
system intended to support the community will feature the following:
• Assignment of rating points for any activity which may be deemed to be expert
• Storing rating points in the blockchain database
• Voting arrangements related to making any respective idea available through the
platform
The outer portion is represented by a Web interface with primary functions designed to
be used by investors and existing investment ideas as well. Moreover, we intend to
develop a mobile application for iOS and Android.
Localization is another material part of the platform layout development. The platform is
currently available in Russian, and certain parts have already been translated into English.
We will translate all systems into English in the near future, then launch advertising and
promotion campaigns. Further, the translation will be made into Spanish, Portuguese,
Japanese, Chinese and other languages as well.

List of ICOs with the opportunity to learn the details and participate directly on the United Traders website

Development of investment ideas will be primarily represented by new ICO projects
implemented through our proprietary platform. We will deliver several approaches to ICObased investments, including, but not limited to, the following:
• ICO UT - pre-sale of tokens related to projects implemented with the direct
involvement of United Traders. Any start-up may propose a project for which an
assessment could be provided using our mentor and consulting support, and we may
further post it to our investment platform, making it available to investors. UT Traders
and Type C strategies managers will act as investors as well
• Pre ICO - we agree with major projects initiating ICO, and engage them in pre-sale
activities on an exclusive basis (i.e. purchase of a considerable number of tokens for a
large discount). Subsequently, we post to our investment platform an investment idea
which provides for the purchase of tokens related to this project on similar, exclusive
terms, but subject to a minimum entry threshold. Thus, we will have a pool of customers
with an aggregate purchase price equal to that which we spent to buy tokens. So, a
small investor will be afforded an opportunity to participate in ICO in any project
whatsoever, on exclusive terms and conditions which are available to major customers
only
• ICO - we consider various scenarios for affording an opportunity to buy tokens related

to all or the greatest possible number of projects through our proprietary platform.
Thus, any user will be able to buy tokens with regard to any project whatsoever, by
way of using a common interface and analytical data delivered by United Traders’
experts

11

In our opinion, widespread tokenization of shares in private companies will represent the
next stage of crypto industry development. We intend to take the lead in this activity,
focusing primarily on the legal components thereof. Nowadays, our investors buy shares
in private companies and have limited opportunities to sell the same. We seek to increase
the number of investment ideas related to shares in non-public companies. To make this
more attractive, we intend to create opportunities to sell these shares to other platform
users. Subsequently, by way of tokenization, we will grant access to this feature to any
user with a blockchain account (either existing or created by us). Release of those tokens
will also contribute to the further development of UTEX as a pioneer in supporting related
trading sessions.
Initial platform followers will include UT investors who have been working with the
company since 2013, as well as representatives of the cryptocurrency market audience
who learned about the same from either United Traders’ experts during training sessions,
from reports delivered at various conferences, or as a result of broad-scale activities
performed in social networks.
A principal focus is made on involvement of new users through UT Affiliates (a partner
network) and the UTMagazine Web portal (Mega dictionary).
Any profit generated will come from fees payable by investors for participation in any
relevant idea, and authors of investment ideas who post them to our proprietary platform.
As soon as reasonably practicable upon ICO, we will add features which support payment
of fees through UT tokens. We will offer a discount to those who make payments using
our tokens, thus offering more favorable terms and conditions thereto. Initially, the price
will be a dynamic one and linked to quoted prices for UT tokens. Thereafter, as soon as
UT token prices become less volatile and upon higher capitalization of tokens which have
been already released, we will cease to support the foregoing dynamic pricing structure
and switch to payment methods which provide for the use of UT tokens.

12

UT Investment Marketplace.
Objectives
The global objective pursued through the development of the UT Investment Marketplace
is that it shall become an additional name for the venture investment industry. That is to
say, United Traders shall be on the front mind of any person with a bright idea he or she
intends to put into action as soon as reasonably practicable.
In line with expertise gained in the field of development of investment products, and the
impact a well-established interface has on product performance, we believe that the
following goals may be achieved by investor users by the end of 2018:
• It is estimated that we will be able to subscribe roughly 30,000 - 100,000 active users
by the end of 2018
• A deposit made by any user will average USD 20,000
• The user’s lifetime average will total five or more years
• Profit derived from the platform operation will amount to 2-3% of the annual average
investor’s deposit

UTEX as a Cryptocurrency Exchange.
Project Profile

Aurora Trading Platform of United Traders

United Traders Exchange (UTEX) is a project based on the development of a venue
where crypto currencies and tokens are traded. A user-friendly interface adapted for
trading U.S. shares and high performance shall ensure user engagement and high
liquidity promoted by professional market makers operating on stock exchanges.
User Interface
We have been developing exchange business software since 2011. Aurora, our flagship
product, represents a client application designed to support trading concurrently on
several exchanges. We specialize primarily in the U.S. shares market, i.e. a marketplace
where thousands of instruments are traded. As such, the Aurora interface by default is
designed to support prompt and convenient trading operations which involve a huge
number of instruments. And this is a real advantage over existing interfaces of
cryptocurrency exchanges.
Whenever you need to open or close positions for dozens of instruments, you spend far
less time making any respective transaction compared with other interfaces in a similar
context, which suffer from scalability problems (for instance, existing cryptocurrency
exchanges).
Liquidity
Another problem faced by exchanges is even more important. It is related to liquidity
supply. Low liquidity for most marketplaces is a chicken-and-egg dilemma. No liquidity
means no users. If there are no users, liquidity is unavailable.

UTEX is based on:
https://unitedtraders.com/trading/aurora

14

Aurora Manager allows you to manage a group of traders

Our team possesses proper knowledge to ensure high liquidity through our market
makers. Our team is experienced in launching trading of new instruments, and maintaining
quoted prices upon request by major exchanges. Acting as a market maker, we have
launched trading of European and U.S. shares on stock exchanges in Russia (MOEX and
SPBEX). Moreover, we have proper knowledge and skills in trading market making
strategies in relation to U.S. and Russian shares, futures and options, at our expense when
no one else pays for maintaining the required liquidity. We successfully maintain quoted
prices and derive profit from these activities.
We intend both to involve our own team, and afford an opportunity to a wide range of
professional traders to act as market makers. As such, a flexible incentive program has
been developed, and a highly efficient exchange infrastructure will translate this into
reality.
Users
Professional traders engaged by United Traders, and investors who have been granted
access to the Investment Marketplace, will become the pioneers in exchange users. This
product is aimed at the general public. We intend to involve sophisticated traders, miners,
and cryptocurrency funds.
The legal component of this project will play an important role. We seek to provide any
bank being subject to strict local rules and regulations an opportunity to participate in
such trading as soon as reasonably practicable.

15

UTEX as a Cryptocurrency Exchange.
Action Plan

Aurora
Aurora will become a pioneer product, designed to grant access to a trading platform. As
such, we have developed a program of phased UTEX launching which shall allow it to
mitigate process risks, and at full-scale operation ensure availability of sufficient liquidity.
Initially, we will launch trading on third party cryptocurrency exchanges through Aurora.
HitBTC will become a pioneer exchange in this regard. Subsequently, a list of available
exchanges shall include more exchanges.
Smart Route
Adding a feature which allows it to choose a dedicated method of order execution (Smart
route UT), shall become the second phase of this project. It is designed to enable
execution of large orders at the best prices by way of distributing a certain part of orders
concurrently among several cryptocurrency exchanges.
It’s worth noting that the technology employed when executing such orders is of particular
importance. The higher the performance of any respective exchange is, the more the
efforts required to execute any relevant order with proper quality.
For more information, please read “The Flash Boys” by Michael Lewis. Since 2009, we
have been maintaining a similar track to characters described in this book. It will enable
you to get to the crucks of technologies we offer in full.
Dark pool
Subsequently, we will add another venue to Smart route. This will be UTEX operating
without quoted prices and an opportunity to issue limit orders. A market maker shall
ensure liquidity inside a dark pool. Moreover, we intend to engage major traders to
execute orders through our proprietary platform. Any such trader will be allowed to issue
orders in a dark pool, which are then executed without any impact on the market.
16

UTEX
Further, we will grant access to quoted prices and enable traders to issue limit orders.
As soon as this is complete, UTEX shall be deemed as being in full-scale operation.
Updated Interface
We have already performed a number of tests with Web and mobile platform interfaces.
In 2018, we intend to introduce an exchange Web interface and subsequently a mobile
version.
UT Tokens
Starting in January 2018, UTT tokens are expected to be used to pay for trading services.
Initially, this will be a feature which enables a user to pay for a platform, and then any
trading fee or any amount payable to the exchange as soon as UTEX is launched.
Traders are expected to make extensive use of this feature due to lower costs incurred
versus payment in any other type of currency.
Thus, we will promote adoption of UTT tokens as a payment method by traders.

on the specifics and infrastructure of sites

The turnover generated by traders engaged by United Traders, and trading in U.S. shares,
totals approximately USD 1.5 billion per month. We believe that since there is no
fundamental difference between a wide range of American shares, futures, and
cryptocurrencies from a trading standpoint, a considerable number of investors will
commence trading cryptocurrencies. However, we do not take into account traders
pursuing strategies which are based on specific features of American exchanges only.
An additional volume will be generated by traders who commenced trading
cryptocurrencies on third party exchanges, and are interested in using Aurora from a
desktop trading platform on a daily basis.
Thus, we set a goal to be among the TOP10 cryptocurrency exchanges within several
months after commencement of full-scale operations.
Moreover, by the end of 2018, we expect to be among the TOP3 cryptocurrency
exchanges in terms of trade volume.

Mega Dictionary. Project Profile

The fundamental idea of the Mega Dictionary project is that a multi-language information
portal will be introduced with user friendly and easy to use semantic structure, which
guarantees availability of accurate, updated, reliable and exhaustive information free-ofcharge.
Generally, the Mega Dictionary Web site will represent a common dictionary with a search
engine and topic-based classification of articles, smart interlinks and pop-up prompts
related to definitions being searched, inter alia with relevant audio and video materials,
enabling a user to get the maximum amount of useful and up to date data.

The main source of traffic will be organic, i.e. it will be generated by users forwarded from
search systems upon any respective request.
The second largest source will be represented by users who enter the portal directly, and
are entirely satisfied with the results of previous interactions with the portal.
The third largest source will be represented by social networks.
The Web site content will include topic-based vocabularies, with terms and their
respective definitions, and a wide range of information articles on diverse subjects, which
elaborate on their headings.
The principal source of profit expected to be generated by the Web portal will come from
the search engine, banner, and other advertisements available in the vocabulary entries
and topic-based articles, with payment made on a CPA basis. Afterwards, we intend to
introduce additional sources for Web site profits, such as paid articles posted by our
customers, users subscribing to paid services, and exchanges where articles can be
traded, and authors and translators able to offer their services.
The Mega Dictionary Project is meant to ensure availability of new users of the ecosystem
operated by United Traders to the fullest extent.
We intend to introduce blockchain technologies in the system designed to assign rating
points and make payments to authors.

19

Mega Dictionary. Action Plan

We expect to start writing articles in English, Spanish and Russian.
In 2018, a maximum of 100,000 dictionary entries will be made for each language (terms
and definitions), and 100,000 information articles will be posted to the Web portal with a
relevance horizon of at least five years.
The price per article will vary depending on size, and commence at USD 0.50 per 1,000
characters. Each category will be assigned its own minimum, maximum and target size. In
view of specific features of various languages worldwide and different rates, the price
range may vary from between USD1.00 - 50.00 per article.
Our experience gained through interaction with authors in Russia (utmagazine.ru) showed
that any author is able to generate a maximum of 10 articles a day, depending on the size
thereof. The time required to check these is limited by the number of moderators and
editors, as well as resources available thereto (i.e. automatic checking of spelling and
uniqueness of text). Each moderator engaged on a full-time basis will be able to check
and approve a maximum of 35 articles a day, depending on the size and complicacy of
the subject. A maximum of two months will be required to engage 500 authors and 100
moderators who speak Russian.
Moderators and editors will also be employed from reputable authors. A strict rating
system will avoid a situation where a moderator could be hired to check his or her own
article. Moderators will be engaged both on a fixed remuneration (daily fixed number of
articles to be checked) and a per-piece rate pay basis.
Initially, developers, authors and moderators will be paid at the company’s expense.
To pay authors and moderators out of funds made available by advertisers, we will need
to initially have 50,000 articles per language. Thereafter, Web site traffic will generate
over 50,000 unique visitors per day for each language, allowing it to seek prospective
advertisers as early as Q2 2018. Further increase of organic traffic and expansion of the
user base shall enable us to make future payments using funds made available by
advertisers alone. It is expected that this will be possible as soon as late 2018 or early
2019.

20

Mega Dictionary. Objectives
Languages expected to be used over time will be Chinese, Japanese, Korean,
Portuguese and French.
In view of the proven track record of utmagazine.ru (a Web portal for traders), the
following traffic is expected:
• Each 50,000 dictionary entries with a size not exceeding 2,000 characters may
generate a maximum of 1,500,000 unique users a month.
• Each 50,000 topic-based articles with a size exceeding 5,000 characters may
generate a maximum of 3,000,000 unique users a month
• Thus, subject to availability of 100,000 vocabulary entries and 100,000 topic-based
articles, a maximum of 10,000,000 unique users a month can be expected
• The average monthly number of visits will increase annually due to availability of
regular and new users, and could total 15,000,000 visits per month. Seasonal
fluctuations shall be taken into consideration when forecasting Web site traffic.

FORECAST GROWTH IN ATTENDANCE BY 2019

In Russia, traffic may decrease considerably during summer. However, due to the higher
volume of available content, this potential decrease could be mitigated through an
intermittent growth of traffic during active months. Average monthly values calculated for
a given year based on the proven track record of utmagazine.ru are made available
hereinabove.
The following objectives will be pursued in terms of Web site behavioral factors:
• The average visit depth of 1.5 pages per vocabulary entry and three pages per topicbased article results in average monthly potential page views equal to 30,000,000
• The share of new users equal to approximately 90% will remain stable during the initial
three years of Web site operation, then decrease to 80% thereafter.
• The average visit time shall be equal to at least three minutes. This is expected to be a
minimum threshold.

Orders issued by one user within the Pre-sale are summed up. The total amount
determines the discount amount.
The amount of UTT tokens that a Pre-sale participant receives shall be recorded at the
moment of completion. During the Pre-sale period, a participant is allowed to increase the
purchase amount.
In the event that the announced price of the primary Token sale is higher than the Presale price, the price for the Pre-sale participants shall remain the same, which is 1000 UTT
= 2 ETH. However, if there is an increase in the price of the token during the Token sale,
the discount of the participants of Pre-sale shall be accordingly increased.

Tokens. Payment and Distribution
Token payment mechanism
UTT tokens are paid for in ETH.
Conversion of UTT tokens buyers’ funds in a currency other than the ETH occurs as
follows:
When paying in BTC, USD, EUR, the conversion rate is fixed at the Kraken (mid-price)
exchange at the time of receipt of the funds.
Token distribution mechanism
At the time of registration, all participants will receive accounts in the United Traders
system.
Any UTT token can provide his Ethereum address at uttoken.io from the moment of
registration and up to 27.12.2017 00:00 GMT.
If a participant has provided his Ethereum address, then on 28.12.2017 00:00 GMT UTT
tokens will be automatically credited there.
If a participant has not provided his Ethereum address, then on 28.12.2017 00:00 GMT
UTT tokens will be automatically credited to the United Traders system account. From that
point, tokens can be manually withdrawn or used in the United Traders’ system.

Token Price Outlook
The UT token price is a certain part of the aggregate price for all tokens duly issued.
The higher the aggregate price is, the more the price for each individual token increases
as well.
Therefore, the aggregate price for all tokens issued depends on the following:
• First and foremost, the scope of services rendered through the platform operated by
United Traders, and where UT tokens are employed. If the scope expands, the
aggregate token price is increased
• The number of tokens held by investors and crypto funds. Long-term holding of tokens
results in their withdrawal from circulation, thus affecting liquidity when these may be
purchased by those who intend to make use of services offered through the platform.
The lower the liquidity, the higher the price received by the purchaser of tokens
• Re-purchase of tokens by United Traders. We plan to buy back tokens from the market
if the price is below our fair estimate.
• Due to excessive demand remaining after the ICO, the price at the commencement of
trading on the exchange may exceed the ICO price by 100-300%. Excessive demand
for tokens will be generated by active promotion thereof, and low limits for the number
of tokens which may be purchased by a single buyer
• By way of launching new products supporting UT tokens, and promoting the token
price extensively during the course of the year after commencement of trading, shall
increase its price by several times

26

Tokens and Legal Concerns
Token Legal Status
A digital token by UT is a cryptographically protected method of granting the right to
make use of services and products purchased using such token through a platform
operated by United Traders.
The ownership of UT tokens does not enable the user to derive or receive profit,
revenues or other amounts or payments as a result of any such purchase, holding,
management, administration, exercise, restoration or expiry of any of the rights, shares or
property rights or interest in United Traders or its platform or any other property
whatsoever held by United Traders (or any part thereof).
Any purchaser of UT tokens shall bear all risks and be subject to restrictions related and
applicable to digital tokens, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, including but
not limited to, the following:
• Risk of unavailability of access to tokens as a result of loss of a privacy key or keys
• Risks related to Ethereum platform protocol
• Risks of computer attacks and those arising from security system weak points
• Risk of loss arising from a lower token price
• Risks related to inefficient regulations and/or enforcement measures taken by the
regulator
Citizens or residents of any geographical area where access to or use of cryptocurrencies
or digital tokens is prohibited by applicable laws, orders, rules, regulations, agreements or
administrative acts shall not be allowed to purchase and use UT tokens. This is the case
as well when any purchaser or user is not a U.S. citizen or resident (including, but not
limited to, for the purpose of applicable tax laws and regulations), holds neither a green
card nor a U.S. residence permit and is not in the United States of America or his or her
principal or predominant place of residence is outside the foregoing territory.

27

Howey Test
Pursuant to general practices employed by cryptocurrency markets, any company which
issues tokens shall make such tokens subject to the Howey test. This is done to check
whether any relevant token is a share or not. If it is proven that any respective token is a
share with a probability of at least 50%, then it shall be registered by the SEC, provided
that it is intended to be offered for sale to non-qualified investors residing in the USA.
We do not allow buying of tokens by U.S. investors.
Most companies apply to the relevant consultants, auditors or attorneys for the so-called
‘legal opinion’ to be issued for marketing purposes. We have consulted with
representatives of leading law firms in New York, and they explained that the so-called
‘legal opinion’ issued upon the Howey test is not deemed to be a legitimate document
evidencing the relevant status of a token. This is just an opinion expressed by an expert
executing the same. As a rule, any such opinion is confidential and is not intended to be
published in any publicly available source (i.e. Web sites or White Papers).
We have performed our own Howey test of UT tokens pursuant to generally acceptable
and existing practices. The result was that it was been proven to not be a share with a
probability of 80%. The only reason for it failing to be assigned a probability of 100% is
that certain holders thereof may have expectations for a token price increase, and as a
result they are motivated to buy the same for speculative purposes. However, it neither
affects nor limits the sale of UT tokens to purchasers, and has no impact on further use
thereof through the platform operated by United Traders. This information shall be taken
into consideration by all prospective buyers prior to the purchase thereof.
Interaction with the U.S. Investors
The U.S. capital market is of strategic importance to our company. As such, we have held
extensive consultations with experienced legal advisers from the USA to develop a
strategy for the incorporation of proper legal entities, the receipt of required licenses and
permits by the SEC to provide relevant investment services, and the issuance of tokens
and the establishment of an exchange for the subsequent circulation thereof, as well as
cryptocurrencies and investment products. Upon foregoing consultations and the
development of a final action plan related to the U.S. market, the White Paper may be
amended for the permitted purchase of tokens and use thereof by U.S. investors.

Road Map. Completed stages
Development of the UT brand · February 2009
United Traders was incorporated as a proprietary
trading company. The primary specialization is
intraday trading of U.S. shares. Founders: Roman
Vishnevsky, Dmitry Belousov and Anatoly
Radchenko, traders from Swift Trade (Canada) and
Dimension Trading (USA).

First office of United Traders, 2009

First workshops · 2010
A proprietary trading business model provides for
continuous training of newbies selected after holding
respective tests and interviews. However, in view of
the suggestions expressed by applicants, we
launched paid training sessions as well. This involved
Doors Open Days and public events held in various
cities in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.

Seminar for Employees, 2010

Arche launched · 2011
A platform for active traders dealing with U.S. shares
was developed by UT after several attempts to launch
algorithmic trading, which gained general recognition
by traders operating in the NYSE and NASDAQ.

UT Magazine launched · 2011
The online magazine for traders was introduced.

Global training sessions launched · 2011
Paid trading-related workshops rapidly transformed
into practical training sessions for traders. All
attendees were afforded an opportunity to become
traders engaged by UT. Each trainee attending a
practical training session was and is still granted
access to his or her personal account with
purchasing power starting from USD 20,000 and
ending up with several millions subject to adherence
to applicable risk management rules.

Aurora launched · 2012
A great number of professional traders operating on
the stock and future exchanges in Russia were
interested in the services we offered. Instead of
adding markets to Arche, we developed another
platform capable of supporting trading activities at
numerous markets and a great number of traders
operating in parallel. Thus, a multilingual platform
emerged which is designed to be used by active
traders (Aurora). Currently, it supports operations at
the NYSE, NASDAQ, BATS, ARCA, CME, CBOE,
CBOT, EUREX, MOEX, SPBEX, Kraken and BTC-e
(previously).

Kvadrat Black launched · 2012
In response to regular requests filed by the UT target
audience, a pool of algorithmic strategies was
generated to enable each user thereof to trade U.S.
shares with low risks and a 20-30% rate of return in
USD. The foregoing pool is being continuously
updated. Poor strategies are removed and
substituted with more efficient ones. Between 20132016, Kvadrat Black strategies were employed to
manage the like-named hedge fund and received
various prizes. In winter 2017, the fund was closed
and the foregoing strategies included in the list of
investment ideas of the Investment Marketplace was
being developed.

Development of a financial vocabulary · 2014
In 2014, we focused on our new target audience (i.e.
newbies). As such, we showed good performance
through the use of our financial vocabulary. It took six
months to make the relevant entries related to
trading and finance, and these activities allowed us to
increase the overall number of visits by 25 times
during the next twelve months. Analytical data
showed that this model is scalable, and the foregoing
value may be increased by hundreds of times.

IPO launched · 2015
IPO supported by United Traders created an
opportunity to buy shares in a company at the price
offered during the IPO, then sell the same shares
upon expiry of a lock-up period varying from 3 to 6
months. It represented a good extension of the range
of our proprietary investment products. This tool was
appreciated by those who were seeking to earn
more and were ready to bear higher risks. Nowadays,
most investment ideas described hereinabove show
good performance.

Affiliates UT released · January 2017
In January 2017, a pioneer component of a new back
end was released (a partner program). It enables the
user to engage customers and derive profit from
these activities. Both regular users recommending UT
services to their friends and professional traffic
arbitrageurs may earn profits. The partner program
has been developed as a strategic solution designed
to solicit customers instead of entering into a highly
competitive market of traffic purchases operating
through search engines and social networks.

deriving profit from a blockchain revolution. Most
investors appreciated this easy to use tool designed
to invest into the cryptocurrency market.

Conclusion
We have introduced Aurora, an excellent multimarket platform which may be used to
directly access U.S. stock exchanges and other markets as well.
We have created a service that will enable a trader to exchange anything for everything
in the format of exchange trade, or in the format of an exchange point linked to asset
storage and the payment execution machine for any individual or legal entity.
We have created an Investment Marketplace which allows traders to put money into
investment ideas that were previously available only to the select few.
We are creating a platform to nurture entrepreneurial talents and to create a different
approach to savings or investment.
We have created an open ecosystem for the development of professional traders, which
allows them to independently study and, subsequently, find employment in a company,
already being an educated and profitable trader.
We are already creating an ecosystem to build the material wealth of any man,
regardless of his financial literacy.

Join us, sincerely yours, United Traders!
