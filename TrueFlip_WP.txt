Summary
True Flip is a blockchain lottery platform. We have already developed a bitcoin-based and fair-proof lottery
6/49 (Powerball*) and plan to make at least 3 more lottery games. It is the first stage of the development and
we have done half the work already.
In order to fulfill our mission in the best possible way we are making the whole lottery fully transparent: every
ticket sold, every win and financial results will be published on the blockchain.
The second goal is to make True Flip platform as decentralized as virtually possible.
The third, probably the most ambitious goal is to create a platform which could be used by private companies,
charitable foundations and even governments to set up any kind of lotteries White label. Further details are
set forth in this Whitepaper.
As the first step, we plan to create True Flip tokens which will grant their holders an access to a special quarterly game and entitle them to vote on the lottery’s future development. We will also launch a Token Sale in order
to distribute 70% of all True Flip tokens within the community. The team will own 20% of the tokens to remain
motivated to keep on developing the project. The remaining 10% will be used to pay for advisers, escrow and
bounty services. All unsold tokens will be burned.
There will be 21`000`000 of the TFL Tokens issued at the rate of 0.0005 BTC per 1 Token. During the Token sale
14`700`000 Tokens will be put on sale. 10 to 15% of the ticket sales revenues will be allocated to a TFL Token
holder game, held only among the TFL Token owners.
True Flip Group SRL is incorporated in Costa Rica, which officially allows online gambling.
Trueflip.io website contains Terms & conditions, Public offer, Privacy Policy and Referral System Agreement.

1. Introduction
Gambling market overview
According to H2 Gambling Capital (www.h2gc.com), the casino business was a major revenue contributor to
the offline gambling market in 2016. In money equivalent, it accounted for $132.8 billion with a 37% market
share. The lottery segment occupied 30.9% (or $111 billion), followed by slot machines with 19.3% (or $69.4
billion).

When it comes to the online gambling market, there were certain differences. The leader was Betting, with a
48.7% market share ($21.4 billion). It was followed by casino business and lotteries. Each with 26.8% ($11.8
billion) and 8.8% ($3.85 billion), respectively.
As online lottery has an added value and low market share in comparison to offline lottery, it seems that this
segment has strong market potential in the future.

As a result, the size of offline gambling market accounted for $359.3 billion in 2016, while online gambling market was $44 billion. As can be seen from the graph below, both offline and online markets are gradually growing. It is notable that online gambling is increasing with a higher growth rate in comparison with offline one.
According to the H2 Gambling Capital forecast, the offline gambling industry will occupy only 11.5% of the
overall market revenue, whereas online one will keep increasing in the future. It is expected that revenues from
the online gambling market will exceed $60 billion by 2020, at a compound annual growth rate of around 10%.

Blockchain technology in online gambling
Cryptocurrencies quickly seize the online gambling market, turning into the most popular means of payment
among gambling sites. Until recently, only several resources accepted Bitcoins, but today its integration into
payment systems has become ubiquitous.
Many participants of the online gambling market believe that the cryptocurrencies will continue to occupy this
industry. This mostly happens due to its lower regulators control relative to fiat money for both players and
online operators. Other advantages include:
- no need to identify users;
- no restrictions on the amount of transactions;
- acceleration of payments;
- lowering the minimum payment threshold.
It looks like cryptocurrencies are turning into the most reliable, transparent and profitable medium of circulation for the online gambling industry. Soon the online casinos on blockchain will become as familiar as the
Internet.
With the advent of blockchain technology, which gives transparency and cross-border dimension to the whole
industry, it became possible to make an honest international lottery. Moreover, thanks to the new trend of
smart contracts for Ethereum, this lottery can belong to the community and not to a handful of stakeholders.

1. Introduction
So, when we talk about a lottery based on blockchain technology, we are talking about linking the wide lottery
participation in the whole gambling market to the constant and significant growth of Bitcoin’s* share in the
global financial market.

Combined, those trends bring about brand new opportunities for online gambling, especially considering the
increasing number of networked devices and the number of users who prefer to play online and anonymously.
Despite the turnover and the prevalence of lotteries as one of the most important games in the world, there are
numerous problems concerning fair play due to the issues surrounding the raffles and the awards.
As was mentioned above, presently a large number of issues involving prize distribution and fairness of raffles
are observed, which becomes even worse when associated with the difficulty of receiving the prize and the
high fees and taxes involved.
However, with the massive use of blockchain technology, we finally have the opportunity to solve these old
problems, bringing about the complete and total transparency of all the operations involving the True Flip platform as the main change and the most important advantage.
On True Flip platform, all lottery issues such as ticket purchase, random number generation for betting and
draws, prize fund composition, prize tickets verification, prize distribution and other operations are 100% implemented using blockchain technology and open source code available on GitHub**. TrueFlip token (TFL)
holders are entitled to enforce any changes suggested for the platform.

* — Bitcoin is both a cryptocurrency and an electronic payment system invented by an unidentified programmer, or
group of programmers, under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was introduced on 31 October 2008 to a cryptography mailing list, and released as open-source software in 2009. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin

1. Introduction
Mission
Lotteries give a chance to dramatically change one’s life for the better. This chance has always drawn the
attention of millions of people around the world for the past 500 years, giving them hope to improve their
financial condition.
True Flip’s goal is to become the most popular and transparent blockchain lottery that belongs to international
community and offers the biggest Jackpot in the world.
Most of currently existing lotteries are totally centralized or even held by governments and are hardly transparent. Our mission is to build True Flip as a provably fair and decentralized lottery platform that neither any
nation state, nor a single authority, nor members of our team could control.

We also take into account the following points on the way to our goal:
- Online gambling is recognized as the fastest-growing sector in the industry;
- The synergy of the cryptocurrencies and gambling market opens up new opportunities for projects in this
industry;
- The size of the lottery market in the offline sector is about € 100 billion, while in the online sector it is only
about € 3.5 billion;
- By combining the advantages of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies (as a means of payment), we
will be able to seize the market share from classic lotteries by turning their disadvantages into our possibilities.

2. Operating scheme
True Flip is the international anonymous lottery based on the blockchain technology with instant payouts and
the source code of the winning combination is publicly available.
Our game looks the same as any ordinary lottery (for example Powerball): you guess five numbers between
1 and 49 and one number between 1 and 26. We decided to significantly increase the probability of winning
by reducing the total quantity of numbers from 69 to 49, which makes the chance of winning 1.3 times higher
than in Powerball. After that, our system randomly draws six numbered balls and the whole process is totally
transparent.
However, these are all similarities to classic lotteries. Our advantage comes from the fact that our lottery is
fully based on Bitcoin blockchain. Everything concerning draw process must be transparent to every user and
exclude any possibility of meddling with results. We applied those advanced IT technologies to completely
overhaul the rules of the game that had not seen any major changes for almost 500 years. Our goal is to make
it more convenient, open, fair, and valuable.

How does the draw take place and why is it transparent?
The Trueflip.io lottery system works by taking the first block in blockchain which fits in the technical requirements that appears after 8:00 p.m. UTC (which is impossible to know in advance, because last ticket for
the draw cannot be purchased after 19:00 p.m. UTC) and plugs it into the algorithm, which can be found on
Github*, to generate the six numbers for the upcoming drawing. This process repeats for every draw at 8:00
p.m. every day. The full explanation about the process can be watched on Youtube** or read in an article in
Trueflip’s official Medium Blog***.
Because it is a lottery based on blockchain, it is possible to obtain several advantages, applying advanced
technologies to completely transform the way the game is processed:
-

Any person from any place in the world should be able to sign in to our lottery without providing any

private information;
-

The draw process is operated by open-source software. This excludes any possibility of the project’s

team of interfering with the draw process.;
-

Prize payouts are executed instantly, no third parties involved. All payments are shown in the open

blockchain ledger and any player may make sure that we’ve given all prizes in full concordance with lottery
rules.
-

All transactions are reflected in the open registry (blockchain) and any user can monitor payment pro-

cessing all the time.
With that, one needs no ID, licence, or registration to work with Bitcoin - it’s enough just to create a wallet (on
Blockchain.info, for example). In fact, the Bitcoin network is accessible to everybody connected to the Internet. This monetary system, as well as our lottery which is Bitcoin-based and works pursuant to the same rules,
is one of the most friendly and open technologies today.

2. Operating scheme
All those features enable us to provide quality entertainment to any user that wants to test their luck on a
daily basis by playing in the lottery, as well as make Trueflip the number one blockchain lottery in the Bitcoin
community.

Distribution of the prize fund
The system automatically converts every payment to bitcoin and transfers funds to the prize fund of the lottery. The platform prize fund is transparent and always open for viewing due to blockchain technology, and
accounts for 60% of the ticket cost. (for more information about the distribution of the ticket sales revenue,
see the Business model section).
A bet wins when numbers of the ticket match the numbers of the winning set according to the table below.

Winnings* in these categories are determined after calculation of winnings with fixed prizes. The payout fund
is the difference between the amount of the prize fund of the run and amount payable for fixed-prize winnings.
The Jackpot is initially formed at the Token sale stage and is refilled by the lottery tickets being sold.
For more information about the lottery process and winnings distribution see section 9 (Lottery features).

3. Business model
TrueFlip offers a transparent business model for TFL Token holders. Every sold ticket, winnings, withdrawals
and operational expenses will be open for every TFL token holder and recorded onto the blockchain, so it will
not change.
The main service that generates TrueFlip’s profits is ticket sales. The structure below shows how cash flow is
assigned to main areas of expenditures.

The ticket price comprises 0.001 BTC or its Ethereum or Litecoins equivalent. Our basic forecast suggests
15`000 sold tickets per day. This number accounts for only 0.4% of the global online-gambling market in current prices. After the launch of three new lotteries, the daily turnover in our model might reach 50`000 sold
tickets (1.3% of the world market).
After a player buys a ticket, the funds will be distributed as follows:

1. 60% goes straight to the Jackpot
2. 15-20%* for marketing
3. 5-10%* for operations
4. 2% - referral awards
5. 10-15%* to the Token holder game
* This spread depends on policy, that will be agreed with all TFL token holders via voting on said issues.

4. Marketing strategy
Since May 10, 2017, when our marketing strategy started, we have achieved some stats: daily traffic is more
than 35,000 visitors*, more than 18`000+ tickets played daily, and overall winning of 32 BTC. In order to stimulate the steady growth of the platform, users can participate in one or more specific promotion campaigns
accordingly with their user profile and the desired extent of their involvement.

1. All players can spread the word about this innovative lottery platform and invite friends and other players
using their personal referral link. After your referred friends sign up on TrueFlip, he gets a free ticket to start
playing. Users will receive 2% of their referred players’ winnings on an ongoing basis (including the Jackpot!). This feature is also implemented without human involvement and is part of the marketing strategy
called “Friends’ Winnings”. Thus, True Flip users continuously remain interested in inviting other players to
the platform, because each guest ends up increasing the chances of winning in each new draw.
2. Another deep marketing strategy consists in joining a partnership network, which is a technological platform connecting advertisers and partners, ensuring financial and informational interaction between them.
Any kind of business organizations get an opportunity of holding advertising campaigns online. On the
other hand, media partners get instruments for selection and deployment of advertising offers. We are also
developing a widget for quick lottery tickets purchase on the websites of our partners.
3. Given the importance of a well-defined marketing plan, it is impossible to ignore the increase in the number
of Internet users around the world and the effect that blogs and specialised sites have on those users. Despite the huge number of pages on the most varied platforms, the list of most influential pages practically
does not change, varying only the local classification between them. This characteristic allows us to easily
identify the most effective media to run public campaigns. We will also use the power of social networks
and their tools in our marketing strategy.
4. In addition, we intend to conduct various media advertising, PR-campaigns, off-line activities in different
regions and non-standard advertising through the attraction of off-line partners.Concerning the marketing
budget, it is expensive but effective to achieve 250,000+ users per day. However, this detailed plan is supported by financial resources previously set forth in the platform’s fund-sharing strategy. All reports will be
fully transparent for the Token holders.

6. Token Sale
First of all, what differs True Flip’s Token sale from other Token sales is that we have already made the product,
as opposed to others who just promise to develop something in the future.

Why do we still need to sell Tokens?
Here are the main issues:
1.

Jackpot. A lottery is interesting only if there is a BIG Jackpot. For a powerful launch we are planning to
raise 1`960 BTC for Jackpot via Token Sale campaign. This value is achieved by multiplying: 40% * TotalSaleGoal * 80%, where 40% - is a share of funds assigned for Jackpot, TotalSaleGoal – amount of money
raised during the Token Sale and 80% - is the first part of the Jackpot. The Jackpot will be secured on cold
wallets with use of multisignature escrow involving three community stakeholders, while the development
team won’t have any access to this money. So when someone lucky wins the Jackpot, it will be transferred
manually.

2.

Second Jackpot. We understand that the probability of winning the Jackpot is 1:49`504`950. But the
risk still exists, and we must ensure that we do everything we can to protect interests of our contributors.
Therefore, we will have a second Jackpot, the size of 490 BTC, which corresponds to 20% of the funds
assigned for the Jackpot. The calculation is as follows: 40% * TotalSaleGoal * 20%. It will also be stored
on a cold wallet and use multisignature escrow involving three community stakeholders, but will only be
used if the first Jackpot is won. Thus, we minimize the risk of losing interest to our lottery if during one of
the first drawings the Jackpot will be won.

3.

Transparency. We want to prove to the blockchain community that our game is fair. At this very moment True Flip is not 100% decentralized. Our team knows about this and has a plan on how to make True
Flip as much decentralized as virtually possible. Our next goal is to make the lottery independent of any
third-party (including the team).

4.

Development. We plan to develop 3 (three) more lotteries based on smart contracts.

5.

Marketing and PR. We understand that a project can hardly attract millions of customers without a
marketing budget. So selling TFL tokens will assemble a budget for a global marketing campaign.

Token sale details
We have successfully completed the pre-Token sale, in which 1`050`000 TFL tokens were sold (5% of the
total amount). The raised funds will be used to finance operations and to increase the jackpot.

Expected Token Sale commencement date: June 28.07.2017.
Issuance of TFL Tokens: 21`000`000 TFL tokens

20% will be available after Token sale;

2.

40% will be on hold until reaching the KPI (launch of 3 new lotteries);

3.

40% will be on hold for 1 year.

At the initial stage Tokens will be distributed between the managing team as a reward for their efforts to bring
True Flip platform to existence. In the future these Tokens can be negotiated among other partners interested
in development and growth of the project/platform.
All unsold tokens will be burned.

7. Token holders benefits
Once the Token sale is completed, the TFL Token will be available for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges.
At the moment, we negotiate the details with several exchanges and will announce the results as soon as the
agreements are reached.
TFL Token allows its owners to participate in a special quarterly game held only among the TFL Token holders. Its prize fund is formed by 10-15% payments from each sold ticket in the following manner:

•
•
•

payments are assigned to the fund daily after each draw;
the Token owners game is held 4 times a year;
the amount of funds assigned to the fund (within 10-15% of income) is determined by the Token holders
voting;

•
•
•

the owners of the Tokens are notified in advance of the date of the game;
to participate in the game, TFL Token holders must verify their ownership through a smart contract;
TFL club prize fund will be formed in accordance with the following proportion:

According to the basic forecast, at the initial stage True Flip can seize up to 0.4% of the global online lotteries
market (or 0.03% of the world online gambling market), which corresponds to a daily turnover within the system
at 15 BTC. In this case, the potential Token holders game winnings relative to the value of the purchased tokens
will be approximately at 5.2-7.8% per year in BTC, depending on the share of the ticket sales revenue assigned for
the Token holders game.

According to the optimistic forecast, at the initial stage True Flip can seize up to 1.1% of the global online lotteries market, which corresponds to a daily turnover within the system at 50 BTC. In this case, the potential
Token holders game winnings relative to the value of the purchased tokens will be approximately at 17.4-26.1%
per year in BTC, depending on the share of the ticket sales revenue assigned for the Token holders game.

From our point of view, both calculations are very conservative and do not take into account the growth potential of the whole market in general, and the potential of the True Flip platform for further expansion.

8. Token technical aspects
The True Flip platform implements various feedback types according to the result of an operation performed
by the system. No human involvement is required. The purchase of betting tickets is the most frequent operation in the system and any financial movement in the platform is executed in Bitcoin regardless of the form
of payment initially used. However, you can not confuse the financial system with the token implemented on
the platform.
The token allows its owner to become a partner of the world’s largest blockchain-based lottery.

Token smart contract functionality
TFL token is ERC-20-compatible smart contract on Ethereum blockchain. Following this standard means that
tokens will be easily transferable between users using existing Ethereum wallets as well as allow exchanges
smoothly integrate this token into their trading platform. TFL token will be used to Verify.

8. Token technical aspects
Token sale technical aspects
TrueFlip token sale will use Ethereum blockchain. The structure of the sale is presented on the picture. During
the crowdsale there will be two ways to buy TFL tokens: first one is sending Ether directly to the Token sale
contract. If people want to participate in the Token sale using other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin or
Waves, they would need to send their money to the founders in the dashboard, and TrueFlip backend will create
a transaction to issue new tokens.
After that, in both scenarios, Token sale contract will make a ‘contract call’ to the TFL Token Contract to mint
new tokens and allocate them to a public address of a contributor. Token sale contract is the only entity that
will be able to mint tokens. After the end date of the token sale or once all the tokens are sold, TrueFlip founders will issue a transaction that will finalize the Token sale. This will trigger minting the tokens for the team and
prevent future tokens from minting on the TFL Token Contract.

8. Token technical aspects
Voting with tokens
In order to reduce the risks for our supporters and for optimal further development of the TrueFlip project, we
have developed a voting system on key issues that will arise as the project develops. Any owner of the TFL
Tokens will be able to send their offer to the TrueFlip team using a special form on the website.

The basic voting rules with TFL tokens:
- voting is considered to be held if there is a quorum;
- one TFL token equals to one vote;
- only verified tokens can participate in voting;
- only two options will be available for voting: YES or NO;
- for each issue on the voting agenda, a time frame for the beginning and the end of the voting period will be
provided;
- a decision on each item on the voting agenda is made by a simple majority of votes.
Voting of the Token owners is considered to be eligible (i.e. has necessary quorum) only if the number of the
TFL Tokens that took part in the process is more than 50% of the issued TFL tokens. If there was no quorum,
new terms for re-voting on the same issues will be announced. At the same time, on the second vote of the
Tokens owners, it will be considered eligible (that is, has the necessary quorum) if the number of the TFL Tokens that took part in the process is more than 30% of the issued TFL tokens. Proposals with text descriptions
will be created as separate contracts on Ethereum blockchain. In the dashboard, Token holders will be able to
associate their address with their decision on a particular proposal. Once the voting deadline has passed, the
contract will calculate the sum of tokens on addresses for decision as well as a number of tokens against this
proposal. Once all the votes are considered, the contract will save the results of the voting process, and it will
stay forever on the Ethereum blockchain.

Lottery transparency
The lottery happens every day. The winning ticket is picked based on the hash of the first block on the bitcoin
blockchain after 20:00 UTC. It will not be possible to buy a ticket after 19:00 UTC each day. To verify that
there were no ticket purchases after that time all ticket sales will be logged in the Lottery Ethereum contract.
Logging every single purchase separately will be quite expensive. Therefore, to save on the transaction costs,
TrueFlip backend will calculate the hash of each sold ticket and then compute a root hash in a Merkle tree for
all transactions (similar to the way it is done for transactions in bitcoin blocks). This root hash will be published on the Ethereum blockchain along with other information about the current lottery. Each separate transaction will still be available through the TrueFlip platform: information about each transaction should have the
tx_hash, ticket numbers. After the winning numbers are calculated, TrueFlip backend server will log them to
the same contract. Everyone can verify the numbers, as well as all payouts on the Ethereum blockchain and
make sure there is no cheating on the platform.

9. Lottery features
Test period
During the first 3 months after the Token sale the jackpot will be limited to 200 BTC in order to test all the
algorithms in the system and prevent potential loss of the whole funds due to fraudulent actions. As soon as
the platform is audited to be safe, the remainder of the sum will be added.

Jackpot: increase and release
There are two jackpots in the True Flip lottery. Initially, they are created at the expense of funds raised during
the Token sale: 40% of the total funds is allocated to the jackpot, 80% of which is assigned to the jackpot No.
1, and the remaining 20% to the jackpot No. 2.
Jackpot number 2 is a reserve in case of winning the jackpot number 1. It is not refilled by revenue from the
sale of lottery tickets.
Jackpot number 1 - the main, it is played daily and is increased by selling lottery tickets.
If the jackpot is not raffled in the current draw, then the funds from the current jackpot are going to increase
the next. Thus, the Jackpot is growing constantly until the moment when someone wins it.
The platform keeps an archive of draws with the whole history and jackpot amounts for each raffle.
In case of winning jackpot 1, jackpot number 2 becomes the main one. At the same time, a new reserve jackpot
is created. Revenues from the lottery tickets sales are distributed in a ratio of 80:20 to the main and reserve
jackpot correspondingly.

Calculation
The mathematics of the lottery was developed by Felix Sidokhin.
The process of determination of the winning set has 3 stages:

•

Ticket sale for the current run ends 60 minutes before 8:00 p.m. (UTC);

•

At 8:00 p.m. (UTC), the first hash of transactions accessible for everybody on blockchain.info is taken and
this hash cannot be previously predicted;

•

This hash is incorporated into the algorithm that forms 6 numbers based on the arithmetic action. The
source code of the algorithm is open , and anybody can check and repeat calculations.

True Flip platform algorithm is clear and very comprehensible, and it is possible to understand how a winning
combination is generated following the simple steps below:

- Step 1: After the draw closes, the system waits for the next hash in the blockchain
- Step 2: Suppose this is the hash received by the system:
0000000000000000005867634c363284caf01ce5dd2d6e2a6c2ab26030f33493

© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0)

9. Lottery features
- Step 3:

This hash is then broken into sequences of 4 (four) characters, starting from the tail, and trans-

formed into a number using NHEX base 16:

0000 0000 0000 0000 0058 6763 4c36 3284 caf0 1ce5 dd2d 6e2a 6c2a b260 30f3 3493
(3493)16 = (13459)10

- Step 4: The found number (13459) is then divided by module of 49 (or 26 in the last iteration) and the remainder is taken as one of the balls:

13459 mod 49 = 274 * 49 + 33
(hence the first ball is 33)

- Step 5: The system repeats this iteration 5 times and discards numbers which are already in the set (for
the golden ball we simply use mod 26 instead of mod 49)
In case of doubts or just out of curiosity, the algorithm can be tested on TrueFlip website at
http://trueflip.io/check-honesty?lang=en.

Methods of depositing
True Flip platform also incorporates multiple payment methods, so every user has a chance to play the game.
As True Flip wants to be an international company and its founders realize that not every person has Bitcoins,
they decided to add multiple payment processors to the payment method in the hopes to increase the number
of people playing. Aside from bitcoin, these payment methods include Ether, Litecoins, Dash and other cryptocurrencies.
Since True Flip just entered its beta-testing phase, the number of available currencies is limited. However,
TrueFlip’s dedicated development team is working on an in-house exchange to work with a wide range of tradable cryptocurrencies (altcoins).

Payouts of winning
Benefiting from the Bitcoin network features, when a ticket wins, the amount is instantly transferred to the
users wallets under their accounts. Further, users may:

•

send Bitcoins to their personal wallets in any other system and convert Bitcoins to any currency
of their choosing;

•

use True Flip account for any Bitcoin expenses (the address of your True Flip wallet is the same
as in any other system).
