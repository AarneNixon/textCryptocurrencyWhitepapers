ANNEX 1

1. Executive Summary
1.1 The Problem
Digital payments are expected to be a US$3.6 Trillion industry in 2018, growing at a CAGR of 13.5%
through 20221. The majority of this growth is a result of a surge in digital content and e-commerce,
however, the market is changing quickly as commerce shifts to smartphones, the number of consumers
in emerging markets overtake developed markets, and blockchain technology decentralizes everything.
The incumbent stores for content and commerce have failed the small independent sellers with their
monopolistic policies:
The top 1% of content developers dominate 94% of the total revenues on Apple app store2;
App and e-commerce store fees and marketing fees leave merchants with less than 50% of net revenues;
M
 ost app stores and e-commerce stores only accept international credit cards however this excludes
the largest and fastest growing regions and emerging markets, representing up to 85% of the world’s
population;
A
 pp stores and e-commerce sites have unfair policies for merchants: 2 weeks to 3 months to get paid
on sales; the only payment methods available are PayPal and bank transfers, chargeback fees, high
foreign exchange charges, and bad debt fees passed through3.

The e-commerce market has well been established among many of developed and emerging countries
while China has already become the biggest market, globally5. Such success in China is a result of
technological advancement, especially in digital payments, like Alipay, and marketplaces, like JD.com and
Taobao, etc. Such growth is expected in South East Asia, which is the world’s fastest growing internet
region (14% five-year CAGR) and expected to reach 480 million users by 2020. South East Asia’s internet
economy is expected to grow to ~$200+ billion by 20256.

Across different regions, different payment methods are prevalent according to regional local payment
methods7. At the same time, the most popular online payment method globally is still credit cards,
whereas digital payment systems have started to gain more attention especially from China. Cash on
delivery resulting from unbanked end users and lack of payment infrastructure, is still a major payment
method in many of emerging markets, which indicates that there are more opportunities for alternative
payment methods.

3.2 Digital Content and App Stores
An app store or app marketplace is a type of digital distribution platform for mobile and desktop apps.
Android and Apple’s iOS are the two leading operating systems for mobile platforms: Apple’s App Store
and Google Play, the official app store for the Android OS8. In 2017, the two stores combined accounted
for 75% of total app store revenues, globally9.
Other prominent app stores in the Android market include Windows Store, Amazon Appstore, and
Blackberry World. By the end of October 2017, the iOS App Store and Google Play had more than 2 million
and more than 3.5 million apps available, respectively. Furthermore, new apps continue to be introduced
at an exponential rate; during the month ending October 31, 2017, roughly 50,000 new apps launched on
the iOS App Store and over 150,000 were added to Google Play10.
The demand for digital content market, represented by downloads and usage, is increasing at a significant
pace. Year over year, in Q3 2017, downloads for iOS and Google Play combined reached nearly 26 billion
worldwide, growing more than 8% and total time spent in apps worldwide among Android phone users
grew 40%, coming close to 325 billion hours.
As a result, consumer spending on digital content is increasing significantly. In 2016, consumers around
the world spent about $62 billion in app stores. In 2017, app store revenues are forecasted to grow US$81
billion and in 2018, such revenue - consumer spend - across all mobile app stores will grow approximately
30% year over year to exceed $110 billion. Such growth is expected to continue. Worldwide app store
downloads are expected to exceed 352 billion in 2021 with gross consumer spend across all app stores
to surpass $139 billion.
East Asian countries like China and Indonesia, are significantly driving the growth of digital content
market. Among those countries, dramatic changes in China and other Southeast Asian countries are
noticeable, where lower-priced Android devices are popular with the burgeoning middle class. Such trend
will continue to drive the majority of growth. It is forecasted that by 2021, China alone will generate over
$56 billion in app store spend — 40% of global annual revenue.

3.3 Market Failures and Opportunities
3.3.1 Market Failures:
Inaccessibility: Two billion adults worldwide are unbanked and some of the lowest rates of financial
penetration are in emerging markets. Only 20% of the adults in Vietnam and Thailand have savings at
a financial institution. As such, access to traditional financial services and access to e-commerce and
digital platforms are limited due to unstable physical and digital infrastructures.
Limited Opportunities: As the world is getting more integrated through globalization, the goods

and services market has begun to make an impact on different geographies. Sellers in United States
were limited to their local markets, where the upside potential is limited due to slowing growth. Sellers in
developed markets have limitations in selling to large and fast growing emerging markets primarily due
to limited payment option.

Foreign Transactions: As the world is getting more integrated through globalization, the goods
and services market has begun to make impacts to different geographies. Nowadays, selling goods
internationally faces systemic inefficiencies in the e-commerce market due to limited services and
payments in foreign currencies that are difficult to handle.
High Transaction Costs:

Apple Store and Google Play have multiple inefficiencies and this has
discouraged many developers who are now seeking for better solutions. App stores, for instance, take
30% of app revenue and after other service fees from intermediaries, net can be less than 50% of revenue.
Moreover, lack of marketing channels within the markets is also a concern for many developers. Smaller
developers are put into a situation where they have to spend heavily on user acquisition, making it difficult
for them to thrive.

System Integration:

According to VisionMobile, approximately 66% of developers have cited ease
of integration as a critical factor and due to the risk of transaction processing and security concerns, they
have to use well-known marketplaces although other restrictions are severe on those markets. It is cited
that such integration issue is more important by the majority of developers than cost issue11.

3.3.2 Opportunities:
Access to New Markets: Emerging markets are home to 85% of the global population; 2.5 billion

people in China and India alone represent more than a third of the world’s population. Close to 90% of
people under 30 reside within the emerging markets and this is also the age segment that accounts for
the most online transactions (approx. 75%). Traditionally unserved market participants in many emerging
markets will get an access to goods and services throughout the globe through the Jehmi platform and
developed markets’ sellers, who need more buyers, will be able to target a broadened audience.

Mobile Penetration and Payment:

With rapid expansion of new technologies and innovations,
the FinTech Revolution had a big impact on the emerging markets. Exponential growth in mobile phone
penetration has driven such revolution to be efficient and effective, now exceeding 100% in many of
emerging countries like Brazil with 141 handsets per 100 people, India and China with mobile penetration
rates of 84.6% and 76%. While most transactions in emerging markets are still being made in cash, the
shift to electronic and digital methods is happening rapidly with higher mobile penetration rate. For
instance, in Indonesia, only 31% of transactions are conducted using non-cash methods with the number
of cashless transactions growing at an annual rate of 23%. Non-cash mobile payment in emerging Asia is
growing by 22% owing to increasing internet use and the adoption of mobile payments.

Transaction and International Fees: Handling of foreign currencies and transactions as well as

minimizing intermediary fees can be improved through the use of blockchain technology. International
transfer fees and foreign exchange fees eliminated at banks and digital payment methods can be
eliminated.

System Integration: New payment methods that can provide value-added services that are developerfriendly will be able to gain traction in the large global market for digital payments. There is a myriad of
payment systems throughout the world and the ability to aggregate and integrate these together will
create an enormous opportunity.
Security: The most-important feature of digital payments has been and always will be security.
Blockchain technology through decentralized nodes, multiple validations, and permanent ledger entries,
has revolutionized how any type of transaction can be secured.
Rise of social commerce: The rise of social commerce and increase of small mobile commerce
platforms have flourished globally with the ubiquity of social media. According to Instagram, in December
of 2017, their monthly active users have reached 800 million and such large user base has created a
flourishing industry of small merchants using Instagram to advertise and sell their products. Such
merchants, requiring digital payment system, can easily utilize our solution in any market.

4. The Solution
4.1 Bezant Blockchain Platform
Bezant’s blockchain platform consists of both a blockchain and a service platform that work together
to provide Service partners (SPs) with a dynamic blockchain-based payment platform to create new
services. Bezant is targeting SPs with significant user and subscriber traffic across many industries:
game publishing, e-commerce, music and video streaming, communications, social networking, and
media channels.

4.2 Bezant Blockchain
The Bezant blockchain will be created using the Hyperledger fabric technology as a starting point, which
provides a distributed ledger technology (DLT) enabling enterprise-ready network security, scalability,
confidentiality, and performance, in a modular blockchain architecture.
The Basic workflow of transaction on the proposed Bezant blockchain:
0) Assumption: User has downloaded Client and registered with Organization (channel)
1) Client A initiates a transaction proposal and sends this to multiple peers on the channel;
2) Endorsing peers verify (sign) the proposal transaction and submit to the Client A;
3) Client sends endorsed Proposals to Orderer as a transaction;
4) An orderer receives proposed ledger updates concurrently from many different applications in the
network on a particular channel and packages these into blocks;
5) The final phase of the transaction workflow involves the distribution and subsequent validation of
blocks from the orderer to the peers, where they can be applied to the ledger.

1) Identity Authentication Service (IAS)
The Bezant blockchain is based on a private and permissioned network, therefore an Identity Authentication
Service will be required. Rather than an open system that allows unknown identities to participate in the
network (requiring protocols like Proof of Work to validate transactions and secure the network), the End
users of the Bezant network must enroll through a Identity Authentication Service (IAS). The Bezant
blockchain’s key role will be to provide Partners the ability to accommodate a vast number of unique
users in multiple channels simultaneously accessing the blockchain.

2) User Client (Application)
The client is an SDK for authentication and communication and is required for access to the Bezant
blockchain. It represents the entity that acts on behalf of an end user. It must connect to a peer for
communicating with the blockchain. The User client can request transactions, execute queries, and
retrieve specific data. The User client will use an API to support Android, iOS and PC environments.

3) Peers
A blockchain network is formed from peer nodes, each of which can hold copies of ledgers and copies of
smart contracts. A peer is a host for ledgers and chaincodes therefore, applications interact with peers
to access resources. A peer also receives state updates in the form of blocks from the Orderers and
maintains the state and the ledger.

4) Orderers
Orderers form a block by sorting the validated transactions from the Client and is responsible for
distribution throughout the blockchain. This is the only cluster-based service provided in the blockchain
and provides for continuous and uninterrupted service. As the Bezant blockchain service does not require
mining on a public blockchain, it deals with real-time transactions based on trusted users. Therefore, it
can deal with significantly higher throughput and lower fees (or no fees) than existing cryptocurrency
blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

On top of this blockchain, the Bezant service platform will provide a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS)
system design, which will allow Service Partners to create dynamic blockchain-based services for their
users.
There are primarily two types of users for the service platform: 1) Enterprise users and 2) Individual
end users who indirectly use the platform via Service Partners. The number of users on the blockchain
and platform will increase as the Bezant network of Partners grows. The Bezant blockchain will provide
multiple authentication services for each user and will create multiple channels to help ensure that there
are no security problems.
The key attribute of the Bezant blockchain service will be efficient processing. Since the blockchain is
based on a permissioned network, all participants are known and trusted, therefore, fewer levels of trust
and verification are required across node types, and network scalability and performance are optimized.

4.4 Jehmi Wallet
Jehmi Wallet is a payment wallet that end users will interface with and it will be powered by the Jehmi
payment platform. Wallet users will be able to perform a large number of functions directly within the
wallet UI. The key features of the wallet are listed below:

4.4.1 Top-up
Jehmi wallet will provide the most-comprehensive payment options to users in order to top-up their
wallets: e-wallets, SMS and direct carrier billing, prepaid cards, bank transfers and cash payments, and
cryptocurrencies. The wallet service enables local payments on a global scale. When the user tops up
their account their balance will appear as an amount in their local currency.

4.4.2 Purchases and Payments
The Jehmi wallet will allow customers to purchase both digital and physical goods in their local currencies
providing a convenient payment system. This is especially ideal in emerging markets where credit cards
are not commonly available to make purchases for things like mobile games on app stores requiring
credit card payments. In addition to the local payment options available in the Jehmi Wallet, users will
have the option of paying in Bezant tokens in the Jehmi Wallet. The advantage of paying in Bezant tokens
is that when sending to another Jehmi Wallet, there are no transfer fees. This provides a strong incentive
to users to adopt Bezant token as the main currency on the off-chain network.

4.4.3 Transfers
Similar to the payment function, Jehmi Wallet users will be able to make transfers in either their local
currencies, foreign currencies, cryptocurrencies or by Bezant tokens. When sending Bezant tokens to
another Jehmi Wallet, the sender avoids paying any transfer fees. Sending other forms of currencies will
be subject to transfer fees.

4.4.4 Exchange
One of the features of the Jehmi Wallet is to provide a link to an external cryptocurrency exchange for the
Bezant token to be convertible into another cryptocurrency. The exchange feature would be integrated into
the Wallet UI in order to provide for a seamless withdrawal of the Bezant token into the user’s exchange
cryptocurrency wallet in any coin or token of their choice.

4.4.5 Hard Wallet
Jehmi Wallet will provide a hard wallet function where the user can transfer Bezants to a hard wallet such
as Trezor, in order for a safe storage of Bezants offline.

20

4.5 Jehmi Payment Platform
Jehmi Payment Platform is the back-end solution to the Jehmi Wallet. The Jehmi payment platform
solves the key problems in digital payments faced by sellers: limited payment options and high fees.
The Jehmi Payment Platform consists of two main products: Jehmi Pay and Jehmi Wallet, which work
together to plug in and power the payment gateways for e-commerce and content stores.

API. The primary objective of Jehmi Pay is to provide a complete digital solution for local payments; local
payment is a term that refers to leading payment methods that prevail in a certain country that may or
may not be unique to that region.

4.5.2 Jehmi Pay API
Jehmi’s API gives content and e-commerce developers complete access to Jehmi’s Billing & Payment
technologies and modules, facilitating the consolidation of the seller’s account in one easy-to-use API for
credit cards, alternate payment methods, and cryptocurrencies; and our own native token, Bezant.

4.5.3 Billing & Payment
Jehmi Pay’s billing solution is an efficient and scalable billing system that will be customized to support
native mileages/rewards points, eBook services, App stores, music services, and e-commerce. The core
features of this module will be aimed at providing an intuitive and customizable customer checkout and
payment system. The objective of the billing platform is to help sellers maximize revenues by providing
these main features: content and product management, registration, revision, cancellation, receipt,
account balancing, and management.
The Payment platform in Jehmi Pay aggregates and integrates hundreds of alternative payment methods
and payment gateways from around the world. This allows a seller of content or products to be able to use
one payment solution, Jehmi Pay, to sell across the globe, transcending the payment limitations found in
emerging markets. Jehmi Pay will provide the most-comprehensive payment options to users: e-wallets,

21

SMS and direct carrier billing, prepaid cards, bank transfers and cash payments, and cryptocurrencies,
including our own native token, Bezant.
Payments will also be optimized for each country’s local payment methods to provide convenience to
customers when making purchases while increasing revenues for sellers. For example, if sellers have
different items selling in different countries, a simple solution will provide for different pricing in different
markets with local currencies automatically applied.

4.5.4 Security
Security of transactions and Fraud protection will be the most-important feature of the Jehmi payment
platform. Our team draws on its experience having worked at leading online and mobile platforms at
Kakao, eBay, and NHN. We use a variety of security solutions to protect our systems, apply measures to
protect server, client, network, and data, and operate AML and FDS for reliable operation of service.

4.6 Jehmi Content Platform
The first service offering on the Bezant service platform will be Jehmi Content Platform: a white-labeled
platform service that connects 1) Content Providers, 2) Distribution Partners, and 3) End users so that
they can create a better ecosystem for the delivery of digital content such as games, music, and e-books
that will provide for a disruptive solution to the incumbent app stores.
Decentralization of many of the functions of the Content Platform through the application of blockchain
technology will alter the paradigms of company-controlled marketplaces by providing transparent security,
trust, privacy, lower transaction costs, and integrity.
The greatest advantage of these decentralized platforms is the blockchain technology itself. As a
blockchain - think of a ledger or database that contains a history of all transactions that take place on the
platform - the platforms are completely auditable by all participants. This leads to fairer pricing for clients,
as all prices are visible and verifiable. Potential customers are able to select the provider that best suits
their needs, both financially and practically.

4.6.1 Content Distribution
The Jehmi content platform aims to provide a white-labeled solution for media companies, portals, large
corporations, social media influencers, et al. with a complete front and back end solution that will enable
them to sell directly to their customers and not have to rely on the incumbent app stores.

4.6.2 Billing & Payment Platform
The Billing & Payment platform provides for the same services as discussed above in the Jehmi Pay
platform. It is built into the Content Platform and licensed to Content Developers and Distribution Partners.
Here, the Billing & Payment Platform is customized for the specific features related to digital content and
e-commerce:

a) In-app purchases
With some apps, you can buy additional content or services within the app, referred to as “in-app
purchases”. There are four types of in-app purchases available on app stores; 1) consumable (used once,
are depleted e.g. in-game currency), 2) non-consumable (purchased once and do not expire e.g. books or
expansion in a game), 3) auto-renewal subscriptions (access to services or periodically updated content,
such as monthly access to cloud storage where users are charged on a recurring basis until cancelled),
and 4) non auto-renewal subscriptions (access to services or content for a limited duration). In-app
purchases account for the largest portion of sales in app stores and require a significant level of flexibility
in design. The module will provide for geographic-specific prices and have access to hundreds of price
points across all currencies. Content providers can set the prices they find suitable for subscribers in
different markets.

Consumable apps (digital item purchases)
In order to support digital item purchases, a feature for copyright protection will be required. When
a copyright owner creates and registers content via Jehmi’s digital item purchase module using
blockchain technology, the purchase history of the user will be proved and the technology to ensure
transaction history and transparent revenue distribution will be provided.

Subscriptions
 ubscriptions are used primarily for content services such as music and movie services and support
S
one-time payments and automatic recurring payments. One-time payments work very much like inapp purchases and automatic payments support automatic billing at regular intervals, depending on
the product.

b) E-commerce payments
Jehmi’s billing & payment system is a flexible solution that can be adopted for the payment of all types
of physical products through the Jehmi API module. E-commerce services can use Jehmi’s API in order
to accept local payment methods, including the Bezant token, and provide global payment services and
reduced fees anywhere in the world.

24

4.6.3 Marketing Platform
In Jehmi’s marketing platform, Content Providers(CP) can more efficiently promote their services through
the use of big data integrated into the content platform. The marketing platform will assist the Content
Providers to promote their applications in broader marketing channels using in-app advertisements
integrated with Jehmi-affiliated external advertisement channels. Also, a Content Provider can use Jehmi
Marketing platform to add in-app advertisements for additional sources of revenue.
Distribution Partners(DP) can operate various types of marketing campaigns as more efficient marketing
channels to maximize profit. Jehmi’s marketing platform is developed through the following four modules:

Data Analytics
In the content platform, both the DP and CP can obtain information on user data within the platform.
With this analytics data, an algorithm recommends certain content that matches the users’ unique
profiles in order to show content that would most-likely appeal to users and thus lead to subsequent
purchases.

Marketing Tools
 fter content exposure to users through big data based optimization, if the Content Provider wishes
A
to continue to promote their content, they can use the marketing tool provided by Jehmi Marketing
tools module to have control over their own marketing campaigns.

External Advertising Platforms
I n order to optimize the marketing experience for both DPs and CPs, the Jehmi Marketing platform will
integrate and link with 3rd party advertising platforms. The goal is to provide a seamless experience
so that content provider can easily add in-app advertisements.

4.6.4 Business Intelligence Platform
The Jehmi Business intelligence provides valuable information sourced from the Marketing platform so
that it can be shared with all users within the Jehmi Content Distribution Platform. Based on the big data
occurred by Content Providers, Distribution Partners, End Users, Payment Gateways via Jehmi’s various
platforms, the solution provides user demographic information, user pattern analysis, app usability
analysis, revenue analysis, and customer analysis.

8. Participation in the Token Sale
8.1 Participation
(a) All participants are required to register on bezant.io to submit relevant KYC documents for approval
by BZF team prior to the public sale. KYC documents will include proof of identity and proof of residence.
Further documents might be required in certain cases. KYC is required to prevent BZNT, BZF or Jehm
from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, by criminal elements for money laundering or terrorism
financing activities. All prospective participants who are interested in participating in the Token Sale
must carefully read this document in its entirety. Information contained or linked on bezant.io is not
incorporated by reference into this document and is not a part of this document.
(b) If a participant fails to provide the requested information to complete the KYC checks or does not meet
the requirements of the KYC checks (in BZF’s absolute determination), the participant’s subscription shall
be deemed null and void (determined at the sole discretion of BZF) and no rights to BZNT shall be created
or granted to that prospective participant. In these circumstances, any subscription amount sent to BZF
will be refunded (net of any administrative fees).
(c) Participation in the Token Sale will not be available to a person (citizen or resident, tax or otherwise)
and any company or association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated, of the following
jurisdictions:
(i) the United States of America; and
(ii) the People’s Republic of China;
(iii) such other jurisdictions whereby the purchase of BZNT or similar digital token/ cryptocurrency
may be prohibited or the Token Sale is deemed to be non-compliant with applicable laws and
regulations.

8.2 Transfer of ETH
(a) During the public sale period, BZF will release the Token Sale address where participants can send ETH
to in exchange for BZNT. Participants should send ETH from their MyEtherWallet address rather than
exchange address to facilitate the transfer of your ERC-20 BZNT. As exchange wallets cannot support
the holding of new ERC-20 tokens such as the BZNT, any ETH transfers from exchange addresses
will result in missing BZNT. Any website releasing a Token Sale address before the start of the public
sale is likely to be a fraud. Please be careful and take extra precaution when transferring ETH to the
contract address as sending ETH to the wrong address is irreversible. Neither BZF nor Jehmi will be
responsible for any lost ETH.

35

(b) When the public sale is open, BZF will email you the contract address for the fund transfer, subject to
completion of KYC checks to the satisfaction of BZF. Please contact your respective cryptocurrency
wallet for details on how to transfer ETH out to another address.
(c) Once the ETH transfer is made, BZF will verify the transaction and transfer BZNT to the address from
which ETH is successfully sent from or provided by the participant at the end of the Token Sale. BZNT
will be transferrable once the Token Sale has concluded and all checks satisfactorily confirmed. This
transaction can take up to 24 hours, so please be patient and check your wallet regularly. Should you
not receive your BZNT within 24 hours, please contact us at info@bezant.io and we will get back to
you as soon as we can.
Do take note that only ETH sent from wallet addresses associated with an approved KYC will be accepted
by the Token Sale contract. Any ETH received from non-approved KYC wallet addresses will be refunded
and not allocated any BZNT.

36

ANNEX 1 – LEGALESE AND RISK FACTORS
1. RISK FACTORS
The Token Sale, the business and operations of Jehmi and BZF (including but not limited to the Bezant
Protocol, Jehmi Payment Platform, Jehmi Content Platform and Jehmi Business Intelligence Platform,
and the issue and distribution of BZNT) (collectively, the “Project”) are subject to numerous risks, many of
which are beyond the control of Jehmi and BZF. Outlined below are certain development risks associated
with the Project and does not cover all risks associated with the Project.
Each Participant should complete independent due diligence into the Project, peruse, comprehend, and
consider carefully the risks described in this Whitepaper before deciding to support the Token Sale.
Supporting the Token Sale shall be an action based upon prudent decision and will be deemed as the
relevant Participant having been fully aware of and agreed to take all the risks described in the Whitepaper.

1.1 TECH
(a) D
 evelopment. The Bezant Protocol, Jehmi Payment Platform, Jehmi Content Platform, and Jehmi
Business Intelligence Platform (collectively, the “Project Platforms”) are currently under development
and may undergo significant changes before release. The Jehmi Payment Platform will feature
the Jehmi wallet and support in-app purchase support, subscription payment support, exchange
support, digital item purchase support, and e-commerce payment support. Without completing
the development of the Bezant Protocol and Jehmi Payment Platform, it will be impossible to
fully anticipate the challenges associated with ensuring the Jehmi Payment Platform to be able to
incorporate the components. Depending on the implementation challenges, there may be changes to
the design, implementation plans, and execution of the Project Platforms. While the Jehmi team will
use its reasonable efforts to develop and implement the Project Platforms, there is no assurance that
a completed version of any Project Platform, will be released and/or operational.
(b) R
 eliance on internet infrastructure. The Project relies on the performance and reliability of the
internet infrastructure of the markets in which it operates. There may not be alternative networks or
data servers in the event of failures or interruptions with the internet infrastructure. Any unscheduled
service interruption or failure could result in unavailability or limited performance of any Project
Platform.
(c) E
 rrors in source code. Despite security audits and peer review, nobody can guarantee that the code
used by both Jehmi and BZF is error free. It may contain certain flaws, errors, defects, and bugs, which
may disable Jehmi and/or BZF in their operations. Such flaws, if any, would compromise the usability,
stability, and/or security of the BZNT, and the Project, and consequently bring adverse impact on
BZNT, and the Project.

1.2 TOKEN
(a) L
 oss of private key. Private keys are necessary for accessing blockchain assets. Should a private key
be lost or destroyed, access will be permanently unrecoverable. The loss of a private key either by
Jehmi or a Participant could result in the loss of BZNT.

37

(b) V
 olatile nature of cryptocurrency. The price of cryptocurrencies such as ETH has historically
experienced large fluctuations. The value of funds raised by the Token Sale may drop significantly
in case of a sharp drop in ETH price. Since Jehmi will need to use funds in the fiat currency of each
market the company operates in, a drop in the value of the funds will result in reduced resources for
Jehmi to operate.
(c) T
 ermination of Token Sale. The Token Sale could be terminated early due to unforeseen circumstances.
If funds in ETH have been exchanged to fiat, Participants may be refunded with only part of their ETH
payments due to the volatility of ETH and/or costs incurred to conduct the Token Sale by BZF.
(d) L
 iquidity of BZNT. Trading of the BZNT is not a responsibility or objective of Jehmi or BZF. Secondary
trading of BZNT will be conducted between voluntary market Participants. There may be a possibility
that BZNT is not attributed any value or offered for trading by exchanges or marketplaces, which
would incur difficulty for the token holder to divest their tokens. Due to different regulatory regimes
in different jurisdictions and the obstacles of citizens of certain countries to open accounts at
cryptocurrency exchanges, the liquidity of BZNT may be materially different in different countries
thus resulting in substantial price discrepancies.

1.3 COMPETITION
(a) C
 ontent distribution businesses. There are other businesses looking to develop some form of content
distribution service. The Jehmi Content Platform seeks to maintain a competitive advantage through
its incorporation of blockchain technology and decentralisation characteristics, the combination of
which provides greater transparency, security, privacy and lower transaction costs, and integrity. On
the back-end, the Jehmi Payment Platform will be integrated so that all prices and transactions are
visible and verifiable. Potentially one of these competitor businesses could produce, a better, cheaper,
more accessible, versatile, or customer friendly product, relative to the Jehmi Content Platform. The
Jehmi Content Platform may make changes to the features and components of the Jehmi Content
Platform to address market demand and obtain an advantage over comparable products, thus
increasing its funding requirements.
(b) P
 ayment services. The adoption of BZNT as the native virtual currency of the Jehmi Payment Platform
faces competition from debit and credit card providers and other traditional business in the payment
service providers. If these businesses could produce a better, cheaper, more accessible, versatile,
or customer friendly product, the use of BZNT, the Jehmi Payment Platform, and the Jehmi Content
Platform will face increased competitive forces.
(c) P
 erceived or exposed flaws. It is possible that a comparable product could become popular due
to a perceived or exposed flaw of any Project Platform that is not addressed by Jehmi effectively
and expediently. There may also be a perceived advantage of a comparable product that includes
features not incorporated in any Project Platform. If this product achieves a significant market share,
the financial condition of Jehmi will be adversely affected and there may be a negative impact on the
demand for and price of the BZNT.

38

1.4 SECURITY
(a) P
 rivacy of Jehmi Private Net. Jehmi has access to a large amount of information through the Jehmi
Payment Platform, the Jehmi Content Platform, and the Jehmi Marketing Platform. The improper
use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation. Jehmi may be subject to security
breaches and attacks, which may compromise the security of the information store in the private
net Jehmi maintains. Jehmi may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or
prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Failure to do so would result in a loss in confidence
of the Jehmi’s business.
(b) T
 heft of proceeds. There may be attempts to steal the Token Sale proceeds received by BZF (including
the fiat currency amount converted therefrom). Such a theft or attempted theft may impact the ability
of BZF to make the grant to Jehmi to support Jehmi’s expansion and development of the Project
Platforms. This would have an impact on the corresponding endowment to Jehmi. While BZF will
adopt best practice technical solutions to keep the Token Sale proceeds safe, certain cyber-thefts
may not be preventable.
(c) O
 ther security flaws. With Ethereum and smart contracts being a relatively new area, there are still
some areas where security issues are being discovered. Consequently, it is uncertain that any audit
will uncover all security flaws.

1.5

THIRD PARTY

(a) R
 eliance on content developers and distribution partners. The Jehmi Payment Platform and Jehmi
Content Platform primarily relies on third-party content developers to make available their digital
content such as games, music, and e-books on the Jehmi Content Platform. Jehmi may not be able
to establish or maintain mutually beneficial commercial relationships with content developers and
distribution partners. Any failure by Jehmi to effectively localise or market the Jehmi Content Platform
and Jehmi Payment Platform may adversely impact the utilisation level by content developers and
distribution partners of the Project Platforms and BZNT.
(b) O
 ther third party failures. Jehmi’s business involves dependency on other service providers. For
example, a temporary shutdown of Jehmi’s cloud web server could lead to the Jehmi service being
put on hold. As the business grows larger, Jehmi will work to reduce the dependency on third party
services.

1.6 MARKET RISK
(a) L
 imited interest. There may be limited interest in the content development and distribution community
in the use of utility tokens or virtual currency for purchases. As the Jehmi Payment Platform, Jehmi
Content Platform and Jehmi Marketing Platform are new products, there is no certainty that the Jehmi
Payment Platform, Jehmi Content Platform or Jehmi Marketing Platform and BZNT will be adopted
or used by a large number of content developers and content distributors. The size and engagement
level of the Jehmi Content Platform’s user base are critical to the success of Jehmi. Jehmi and BZF
cannot assure that the user base and engagement levels of the Jehmi Content Platform will grow.
Such a limited interest could adversely affect the development of the Project Platforms and usage of
BZNT.

39

(b) E
 xpansion challenges. As the Jehmi Payment Platform and Jehmi Content Platform expand their
operations, there exist a risk of the new markets not responding to the Jehmi Payment Platform.
Jehmi Content Platform, or the use of BZNT due to differences in the economic and infrastructure
development, political, cultural, legal, and regulatory systems among the countries in which it operates.
(c) I nability to attain business partners. Jehmi may not be able to find business partners in a new market
entered, leading to poor business performance.
(d) A
 decrease in the growth of digital content. Jehmi and the Project Platforms are dependent on the
growth of digital content for its success. The business of Jehmi and the user base of the Project
Platforms may be adversely impacted if the market size of digital content decreases or fails to grow
at a satisfactory rate.
(e) N
 o prior market. Prior to the Token Sale, there had been no public market for the BZNT. There is no
assurance that an active trading market for BZNT will develop, or if it develops, be sustained.
(f) P
 rice Volatility. The trading market price of BZNT may fluctuate significantly and rapidly as a result of,
amongst others, perceived risk of BZNT, negative publicity on Jehmi, BZF, the Project Platforms or the
operating performance of Jehmi.

1.7 REGULATORY RISK
(a) N
 ew token regulation introduced. Regulatory authorities around the world may introduce new
regulations to regulate the use of crypto-tokens. BZF may receive queries, notices, warnings, requests
or rulings from one or more regulatory authorities from time to time, or may even be ordered to
suspend or discontinue any action in connection with the Token Sale or issuance of BZNT. Regulatory
authorities around the world may also deem BZNT as virtual commodities, digital assets or even
securities or currencies and therefore could be either prohibited from being traded or held, or be
permitted to be traded or held, subject to the tax levied, in certain jurisdictions pursuant to local
regulatory requirements.
(b) R
 egulation of Ethereum. Regulation of the Ethereum network may be introduced leading to a
restriction of access to its networks. An update/migration strategy and implementation will need to
be developed urgently.
(c) R
 egulation of distributed ledger technology. The Bezant Protocol is developed as a private blockchain.
Regulatory authorities around the world may introduce new regulations to regulate entities carrying
on a business that uses distributed ledger technology for storing or transmitting value. BZF may
receive queries, notices, warnings, requests or rulings from one or more regulatory authorities from
time to time, or may even be ordered to suspend or discontinue any action in connection with the
issuance or transmission of BZNT.

1.8 OTHER
(a) C
 onflict of Interest. There may exist potential circumstances where the interests of Jehmi may diverge
from those of BZNT holders. Jehmi is not obliged to refrain from such decisions in the interests of
the company. By supporting the Token Sale, each Participant will be deemed to have acknowledged
these potential conflicts of interest and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising
from the existence of any such conflicts of interest.

40

(b) U
 nknown unknowns. Jehmi and BZF recognise that there are things that will be discovered in the
development process which at this point cannot be predicted. In other words, despite best efforts,
Jehmi and BZF may not yet know all the risks that will be associated with the Project. Part of the
rationale behind the fundraising is to ensure that Jehmi and BZF have sufficient funds to be able to
solve such issues as they arise and be able to continue to grow the business.

2. SUPPORTING THE TOKEN SALE
2.1

Supporting the Token Sale is voluntary. No person will be deemed as committed or obliged to support
the Token Sale as a result of visiting bezant.io, registering himself/herself with bezant.io, requesting or
reading any materials (including the Whitepaper) made available by BZF or communicating with BZF in
any manner.

2.2

Each person shall only support the Token Sale (a “Participant”) through direct participation with BZF, subject
to such person’s satisfaction of BZF’s “know-your-customer” and “anti-money-laundering” exercises. The

(a) a person (citizen or resident, tax or otherwise)
(b) any company or association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated,
of the following jurisdictions:
(i) the People’s Republic of China;
(ii) the United States of America; and
(iii) such other jurisdictions whereby the purchase of BZNT or similar digital token/ cryptocurrency may
be prohibited or the Token Sale is deemed to be non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations.

2.3

Each Participant will, upon supporting the Token Sale, be deemed as having perused and comprehended
the Whitepaper in full (among other things, the risk factors of the Project) and having voluntarily accepted
all the terms and conditions including but not limited to the disclaimers made and the risks disclosed in
the Whitepaper.

2.4

BZF shall be entitled to take any action to identify any Participant at any time, even after the closing of the
Token Sale. If BZF conducts “know-your-customer” exercises or any other kind of customer due diligence
to verify the identities of all or part of the Participants, the Participants concerned shall provide all such
information on a timely basis and shall meet all such requests as may be sought or instructed by BZF for
that purpose. This shall equally apply to Participants who purchased BZNT via the secondary markets, or
other secondary purchase mechanisms, as well as primary sales during the Token Sale.

2.5

If BZF discovers the purchase of BZNT by any Participant violates any anti-money laundering, counterterrorism financing or other regulatory requirements, such purchase shall be invalid with retroactive effect
and BZF shall be entitled to immediately deny the relevant person’s admissibility to the Token Sale, reject
delivery of any BZNT, irrespective of any payment that could have been made by that Participant.

41

3. NON-FINANCIAL NATURE OF BZNT
3.1
