WHAT IS DETHER?
____
Dether is an international peer-to-peer network of individuals willing to buy and sell
cryptocurrency with cash and spend it at physical stores nearby.
We created the Dether ecosystem to be a bridge between crypto and fiat all over the
globe. I​ nspired by Satoshi Nakamoto's vision to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash
system for Bitcoin, coupled with the state of the current, unfair remittance market,
we decided to create ​an easier solution for financial inclusion that incorporated the
vast potential of blockchain, available to users across the globe using cash, and
without the need for a bank account.

WHAT IS THE DETHER APP?
____
The Dether App is your cash to crypto on/off ramp. It is a decentralized mobile
application (dApp) that enables individuals in over 140 countries to buy and sell
crypto locally with cash — no bank account needed, and no fees taken by us.
First launched on testnet in 2017, then on mainnet in August 2018, the Dether app
creates a direct bridge between cash and cryptocurrency. With the Dether App, we
have built a frictionless solution for individuals willing to trade crypto with others.

WHAT IS THE DETHER PROTOCOL?
___
Built on Ethereum blockchain, the Dether protocol provides developers a set of
decentralized tools to create a bridge between cash and cryptocurrency.

1. INTRODUCTION
____
With the 2007 financial crisis still leering over the economy, the need for a
decentralized banking solution has come to the forefront of ingenuity. Against the
backdrop of raising awareness and the need for more trusted global solutions,
blockchain technology opened doors for new opportunities by using cutting-edge
technology to serve societies all over the world. The technology initially underlying
the Bitcoin protocol has the power to have a great impact on our society by
transforming our industries. Financial services, healthcare services, even
governance: a wide range of fields could be disrupted using blockchain technology.
And by disrupting those multiple fields, it could also allow for better inclusion of
populations left behind by globalization.
The creation of the first blockchain with Bitcoin has highlighted the fact that
decentralization is the core value of blockchain. Going through a centralized
organization or institution has a systemic risk, being that this central entity is in fact
a single point of failure that can destroy everything that’s below it.
Blockchains are powerful because they generate decentralization. Decentralization
has the unique ability to give people control back over their rights, their digital assets,
their data, their vote and more.
More than a simple digital currency, cryptocurrencies offer promising opportunities.
Blockchains enable anyone to access and interact with decentralized applications
(dApps) and smart contracts. It gives the disruptive ability to build trustless digital
societies and organizations in which its applications don’t have any kind of
censorship, fraud or third party interference; societies where you can participate in a
democratic and autonomous organization with trust, and without previously knowing
any participants. The power of Blockchain technology and its extremely active
community opens up a world of possibilities for the future of our society.
Blockchain technology is flexible and ready for scaling in the near future, with
prospects for off-chain systems.

2. CHALLENGES TO CRYPTO MASS ADOPTION AND
OBSERVATIONS
____
Decentralization is at the heart of blockchain; it is even viewed, in the words of Vitalik
1
Buterin, as “blockchain’s entire ​raison d’être .”
As an example, Ethereum enables anyone to build unstoppable applications: a
trustless digital world where its applications don’t have any kind of censorship, fraud
or third party interference. A world where you can participate in a democratic and
autonomous organizations without previously knowing any participants.
In fact, when one buys crypto, it then becomes possible to access and interact with
blockchain. While we’re living in an important time in history, where blockchain
technology, and especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, are changing the world, one of its
greatest challenges remains mass adoption.
At Dether, our goal is to break barriers to crypto mass adoption. We are driven by our
mission of making it easy for individuals across the globe to buy and sell ether,
Bitcoin and ERC20 tokens.
Yet, buying and selling crypto remains a centralized process that’s long, difficult and
unnecessarily excludes over 2 billion people:
❖ It takes time and costs money. Registering online, depositing money and
getting verified takes days or weeks. And time is money.
❖ Decentralization is at the core of blockchain’s value proposition; yet, central
entities still play a major role in the process of buying cryptocurrencies.
❖ The overly complex buying process creates barriers to mass adoption, as
more than 2 billion adults are unbanked and don’t have the necessary bank
account or personal identification to buy cryptocurrency.

3. SAY HELLO TO DETHER
____

3.1 A CASH-IN CASH-OUT CRYPTO SOLUTION
____
Dether is a network of individuals and businesses willing to buy and sell crypto,
Bitcoin and ERC20 tokens without a middleman. ​Dether enables individuals to buy
and sell crypto using cash and spend it at physical stores listed on the Dether map.

DETHER.IO​ l ​6

3.2 THE DETHER PROTOCOL
____
Today, many projects and teams are building decentralized applications in various
industries on top of Ethereum reaching, in most cases, the current crypto
community. In the very near future, these applications could easily reach across the
globe, to anyone that has internet access.
In order to make that happen, we believe that having an easy way to cash-in cash-out
ether and ERC20 tokens is already needed, and will become more and more
necessary--not only for the Dether community of users — but by dApps willing to
target individuals and businesses located in areas where having an access to
financial services, and thus cryptocurrency, is limited. In order to build an
increasingly stronger network, we need to facilitate access to it. That’s where the
Dether protocol comes in.
The protocol enables dApps to easily build crypto cash-in and cash-out services in
their dApp. They are able to register new crypto sellers by themselves (and also refer
them to earn money on their trade), or simply load the list of sellers/shops around
the users.
Built on Ethereum blockchain, the Dether protocol provides a set of decentralized
tools to create a bridge between cash and cryptocurrency.
It is an open protocol built on top of Ethereum for dApps and crypto projects that
share a crypto cash-in and cash-out issue.
Using the Dether protocol, dApps can:

❖ Register​ ​new points of sale in the Dether protocol.​ Similar to 0x’s protocol
model, dApps have the ability to register new crypto sellers into the Dether.
This gives dApps the ability to offer users a way to make extra revenue by
becoming a crypto point of exchange​.
❖ Get sellers from the Dether protocol​. Similar to an API, dApps can load the list
of crypto sellers and shops registered in the Dether protocol. Users are able to
locate the closest crypto sellers around them and shops accepting
cryptocurrency displayed on the Dether map in order to get in touch with them
and transact. DApps are able to freely build their own front-end on top of the
Dether protocol to easily add cash-in and cash-out services to their dApp.

DETHER.IO​ l ​7

❖ List their token on the Dether protocol​. By staking DTH and by providing
enough liquidity, Dether sellers are able to sell a particular dApp’s token for
fiat currency across the globe (using a third party liquidity provider).

Dether.js is a javascript library available on GitHub. It’s all a developer needs to build
an app interacting with the Dether contract, without ever needing to instantiate
contracts.
The protocol is promise-based, which allows developers to use the async/await
syntax.

DOCUMENTATION PORTAL

3.3 THE DETHER APP
____
The Dether app enables individuals to buy and sell crypto for cash and spent it at
physical stores located on the Dether map.
The Dether app is a decentralized cash to crypto on/off ramp. It’s a peer-to-peer
marketplace that allows individuals to buy crypto directly from other people.
Dether offers the unique opportunity to have access to crypto within minutes by
using a phone and spending cash. Users are able to discover crypto sellers near
them on the Dether map and chat with them. They can see their crypto/fiat rate and
the fees that they take when clicking on their profile. Buyers are free to engage a
conversation with the seller they want to trade with in order to agree on the trading
conditions and the meeting point to exchange crypto for cash.
Users can sell crypto, with the freedom to set their own fees. Users can currently buy
and sell ​crypto​ for cash, and exchange ​crypto​ for a variety of ERC20 tokens (​(by
using a third-party liquidity provider, ​and exchange those ERC20 tokens for ether).
The Dether app is available for Android​ and​ iOS as a ​PWA​ (progressive web app).

3.4 DETHER FOR SHOPS
____
By building a decentralized and peer-to-peer ecosystem of cryptocurrency buyers
and sellers, physical shops are naturally interested in targeting them.
Dether for Shops offers retailers a simple way to add their shop into the Dether Map​.
It comes at a moment in history where major online advertisement actors are
banning any crypto related ads, making it almost impossible for legitimate retailers
to advertise it online and welcome cryptocurrency holders into their physical store.
By proposing Dether for shops to retailers​, we hope to fight the censorship of crypto
ads and allow legitimate businesses to freely target the crypto-community.

DETHER.IO​ l ​10

4. THE DETHER TOKEN
____
Just like taxi drivers who must hold medallions to do business in many parts of the
world, users wishing to operate as sellers or shops must stake a minimum amount
of DTH tokens for entry. This requirement helps Dether attract only real users willing
to engage in authentic transactions on the marketplace and Dether map.

4.1 REDUCING NETWORK CONGESTION AND IMPROVING MARKET
SAFETY
____
By allowing any party to easily register and vend on the Dether network, it would be
reasonable to expect significant counts of low-quality or fraudulent listings. To
prevent this, a staking mechanism requires that participants have “skin in the game”
by locking in a minimum amount of DTH prior to transacting.

4.2 PROTECTING AGAINST NETWORK TAKEOVERS
____
Network attackers may raise capital and attempt a network takeover by staking large
amounts to create many fraudulent accounts, increasing network congestion and
undermining the overall legitimacy of the network. With the DTH token, any attempts
to aggressively purchase en masse will be met with sharp price increases, which
would make the attack far more expensive and likely unprofitable.

4.3 STAKING DTH
____
In order to have their point of sale registered on the Dether protocol, Dether sellers
must own a zone. A zone is defined as an area of 1kmx600m. Each zone can be
owned by staking a sufficient amount of DTH on it. Each zone can be claimed by
anyone willing to stake more on said zone, thanks to an open auction system running
on top of the protocol, inspired by the Harberger taxes system.

DETHER.IO​ l ​11

Similar to Dether sellers, shop owners must also currently stake a certain amount of
DTH (42 DTH or an amount decided by the zone owner) to list their shop on the
Dether map.
DApps are also be able to list their ERC20 token in the Dether protocol by staking
DTH and by providing enough liquidity (by using a third-party liquidity provider).
Dether sellers are then be able to sell their token for fiat currency.

4.4 DETHER ZONING SYSTEM
____
Zones are pieces of land that Dether sellers can “own.” Zones must be “owned” for a
particular purpose and are won through an auction.
The auction system takes place like this:
The user selects the zone they want to own in order to benefit from being more
visible. For example, the seller would have to own the zone where he or she wants to
operate.
Each zone may be empty or possessed by another user. The challenging user can
outbid the previous owner with more DTH.
The auction winner “owns the zone” and enjoy the specific benefit for at least 24
hours. Zone owners lose a percentage of their staked DTH every 24 hours to prevent
the concentration of power. As we make more progress, community members are
encouraged to take advantage of our open protocol to create new benefits for zone
owners.

5. THE ROAD TO DECENTRALIZATION
____
Dether’s strategy is to build an accessible network and make buying ether easy for
individuals who have a smartphone and internet access.
We strongly believe that having a trustless solution is the key to Dether’s
development. Users must be able to exchange and trade with one another with trust,
despite not knowing each other beforehand. In other words, we’ve decided to align

DETHER.IO​ l ​12

our strategy with blockchain’s core principles, where the power of its users, and not a
central entity, determines its success.
That’s why we’re following a roadmap that integrates different key elements of
decentralization on each feature we integrate, in order to propel Dether towards an
open protocol.

5.1 PROGRESSIVE WEB APP WITH REACT
____
In a world full of uncertainty, proposing an application that relies on a decentralized
infrastructure, while being dependent on a centralized body (like app stores) is no
longer a viable option.
That’s why from its outset, we envisioned and built Dether to be compatible with the
PWA format. The progressive web app is a new format based solely on web
technologies, allowing a user experience close to native applications, while relying
only on a web browser. Progressive web apps can be installed with a simple click of
your smartphone browser, and thus do not pass through the app stores.

5.2 IN-APP WALLET
____
Dether uses a standard light wallet with an encrypted private key on the device,
enabling the user to safely send and receive ether. The user’s private key is created
on his local device and never sent to any central entity or servers.
A 12-word seed phrase is generated and associated with the user’s wallet. The
backup phrase is a combination of 12 random words set in a particular order and
acting as a tool to recover or back up his wallet. The user, and the user only, is able
to regenerate their backup phrase on their device in order to back up their wallet.
We use the standard derivation path “m/44’/60’/0’/0” so our generated seed phrase
is fully compatible with wallets like Myetherwallet or metamask.
In order to enforce security, the user is invited to set up a password when creating
his wallet to secure his or her wallet access. For example, securing Dether Wallet
with a password enables the user to prevent fraud if their phone is lost.

DETHER.IO​ l ​13

5.3 PEER-TO-PEER MESSAGING
____
Globally, every smartphone user has a three out of four chance of having a chat
application already installed on his or her mobile phone. In addition, each user has a
one in three chance of using two or more chat applications.
But there are two major problems with these applications today.
There are serious concerns in the protection of personal data. Protection is not
guaranteed, and data is often exploited to the detriment of users. However, some
messaging applications, such as Telegram, do better than others by encrypting
end-to-end communications.
There are also hurdles related to the centralization. Here, the solution has yet to be
found. That’s why we are working on a peer-to-peer client chat enabling users to
directly communicate together within the Dether app.

5.4 ETHEREUM SMART CONTRACT AND PROTOCOL
____
Ethereum is a protocol based on blockchain technology. This technology allows for
the exchange of value, like Bitcoin, but also to deploy programs on this protocol.
These so-called intelligent programs are called “smart contracts.”
​A JavaScript library is available with all the functions needed to interact directly with
the smart contract. DApps are able to either add a seller, or get all the sellers
available on the Dether map. For each seller that registers through a dApp, they’ll
have the possibility to earn 0.X% of fee on each of their trade. This happens directly
through the smart contract.
Main functions dApps are able to call:
❖ RegisterSeller: add a new seller on the Dether map
❖ GetSeller: get all the sellers located in a given area
The protocol is fully open. As a consequence, any dApp are able to register sellers
and shops into the Dether protocol. As a dApp that’s using the Dether protocol, they
have the ability to choose:
DETHER.IO​ l ​14

❖ The countries and/or regions where the dApp is operating their services
to/from
❖ Whether their users can see all the sellers displayed on the map or only those
registered by selected dApps or users that passes a KYC process (if the dApp
chooses to implement one to register new sellers into the Dether protocol).
More information about here: ​https://dether.io/en/protocol

5.5 REPUTATION SYSTEM
____
The reputation system is based comments and ratings left by users on a seller’s
point of sale on the Dether map. This information assists buyers in decision-making,
allowing them to distinguish between all of the sellers displayed on Dether Map.

DETHER.IO​ l ​15

Spanish speakers in the world, over 200 million Portuguese speakers, and 200
DETHER.IO​ l ​18

million Russian speakers , we hope to reach many new Dether users. The Dether Beta
app and website have been translated into Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, and
Russian. The Dether Beta app has also been translated into French.
6.1.20 ZONING SYSTEM

____
We are also refining the Dether map to create a zoning system for premium places
on the Dether Map for sellers. A ​geohash system​ is used to zone Dether seller
regions, while a modified ​Harberger tax system​ allows for continuous auction of said
zones by Dether sellers. Zone owners hold a variety of benefits, and are even able to
“rent” out their zone to local businesses.
We use a geohash of size 6 to define users zones, as it correlates to about 1.22km ×
0.61km, or about a 10-minute walk. With the geohash location data, it’s easy for a
seller to share the first four characters of his or her country code to verify it on-chain.
The GeoRegistry.sol smart contract (where the country zone is registered) is as open
as possible. Other users are able to add other smaller areas (like cities,
topographical areas, etc.) to the query to see if smaller areas are included in these
same root zones.
To own a free zone, users need to stake the licensing fees (the minimum being 100
DTH) or add more to discourage other people from entering in an auction for the
zone. To own a zone that’s already occupied, they need first to pay a one time bid fee
to start an auction (this mechanism is in place to discourage ill-intentioned people).
Then user A, (or anyone willing to enter the auction), can bid more than user B to get
the zone over a period of twenty-four hours.
If user A loses his zone, the user gets their staked DTH minus the taxes he’ll need to
pay in pro rata of time he gets the ownership.The taxes go to the tax collector
contracts.

6.1.21 IN-APP CHAT

____
Peer-to-peer client chat enabling users to directly communicate together within the
Dether app.

DETHER.IO​ l ​19

6.1.22 AUTOMATED TOKEN LISTING FEATURE
