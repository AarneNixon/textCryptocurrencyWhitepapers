1. Introducing REVV
The REVV token is a fungible cryptographic token that exists on the Ethereum blockchain. A fungible
token is an asset that is interchangeable with tokens of the same type, so that one REVV token
always has the same value and properties as any other single REVV token.
REVV is the main utility token and in-game currency of the branded motorsports games produced by
Animoca Brands, including ​F1​® Delta Time​, an upcoming title based on MotoGP™ intellectual
property, and a third title to be announced soon. REVV is being leveraged as a cross-title utility, and
the driving force behind the Play-to-Earn model.

2. REVV Anatomy
REVV is a standard Ethereum ERC-20 token with commonly used interfaces. It also supports
contract operators whitelisting to provide approval-free REVV tokens transfers throughout the
company’s contracts ecosystem. This also brings the potential for frictionless native
meta-transactions: the ability to push transactions on the blockchain using REVV as the payment
token for the gas, without requiring the native ETH token at all.
REVV implements the ERC-165 introspection standard, with the following ERC-165 interfaces
supported:

3. Token Economy
REVV is a true utility token that has real use beyond any innate stored value. The purpose of REVV is
to serve as a single currency connecting multiple Animoca Brands blockchain game titles based on
motorsport intellectual property. REVV won’t be burned through use, but instead will be reintroduced
back into the economy after it is used by players for gameplay fees and NFT purchases.

3.1 REVV Allocation
Predefined amounts of REVV are initially allocated to ​F1​® Delta Time and ​MotoGP​. The Reserve will
provide token allocations to new titles as they are added to the REVV ecosystem.

4. Token Utility
4.1 ​F1​®​ Delta Time
F1​® Delta Time provides the first reference for how REVV can be used in Animoca Brands’
blockchain titles, with each additional supporting title adding value and utility to the broader REVV
ecosystem and the token itself.

Utility

Description

NFT Purchases

REVV will be used as a means to purchase
exclusive ​F1​® Delta Time NFTs. The number of
NFTs made available for purchase will be
proportional to the amount of REVV in
circulation.

Gameplay Entry Fees

Players of ​F1​® Delta Time pay REVV as an entry
fee for all of the gameplay modes, which
include the Time Trial and Grand Prix.

Gameplay Rewards

A portion of the gameplay fees collected in
each race will be used as player rewards, to be
granted to participating players based on their
race performance. A portion of the gameplay
fee will also be paid as dividends to the track’s
owners.

Staking

Owners of race car NFTs can “stake” them to
earn REVV, the amount of which is determined
by the rarity and value of the NFT and the
length of the staking period. Players can also
stake REVV itself, and in return receive
additional REVV dividends as well as NFTs.

4.1.1 REVV allocation in F
​ 1​®​ Delta Time
In ​F1​®​ Delta Time​, REVV is pre-allocated to one of four REVV Pools.
Reserve​: ​The Reserve is set aside to funnel REVV into the other pools when required as the player
base grows.

Staking​: ​This is specific to the Staking feature. The Staking pool of 6,020,000 REVV is reserved for
the 2019 race car NFTs, with this pool being active for 12 weeks after the launch of the Staking
feature.
Game Operations​: ​The Game Operations pool will provide gameplay incentives as new features are
rolled out, by increasing the rewards for initial engagement.
Promotion & Marketing​: ​This pool will be used for marketing initiatives, including promotional
airdrops.
