WHY HELLOGOLD
The amount of money in a person’s wallet should not be a barrier to his ability to access financial
products that the rich enjoy. HelloGold wants to remove affordability and accessibility from the
equation through the democratisation and digitisation of gold-based savings and financing.
I worked in Asia in 1997 during the Asian financial crisis and I saw at first-hand how “bad things can
happen to good people” at no fault of their own. As a result of the 1997 crisis, the man in the street
saw their domestic currencies hit by extreme devaluation – in the case of both the Thai baht and the
Malaysian ringgit, this was in excess of 50%; in Indonesia, the rupiah went from 2,600 to the dollar
to over 14,000 to the dollar. For someone who was earning the equivalent of US$1,500 a month, he
woke up one morning earning the equivalent of $700 a month with a devastating effect on how he
could provide for his family. The inequitable impact of these events on the people who were least
able to fend themselves and their families left a lasting impression in my mind. They suffered
disproportionately through no fault of their own, other than the simple, unavoidable fact that they
were financially excluded from the products that were available to protect the more affluent.
Fast forwarding to 2010 and up to 2015, I was the Chief Financial Officer at the World Gold Council
where I was also the principal accounting officer for the world’s largest private gold fund with
US$30b AUM. I saw how High Net Worth Investors and funds alike had the ability to use gold both to
protect their wealth and as a form of collateral to get better financing deals.
With the help of technology, the digitisation of gold will enable everyone, everywhere to enjoy these
same features that gold offers to the wealthy. With HelloGold’s gold-backed token everyone will
only need the equivalent of a fraction of a dollar to save through gold (ERC20 tokens work to 18dp).
And once they save enough in gold, they will be able to pledge it as collateral to borrow at lower
interest rates and without the need for credit history. In short, everyone can save, and everyone can
have access to affordable financing. Democratisation through digitisation.
At HelloGold we have started this journey. Our App already enables ordinary Malaysians to buy
physical investment-grade gold starting with as little as RM1. And we have partnered with Aeon
Credit to develop the gold-backed lending proposition.
Moving forward, the launch of HelloGold’s digital gold-backed token (GBT) will enable us to take our
offer to another level. It will allow us to accelerate financial inclusion across the world. HelloGold
wants technology to truly democratise gold - to empower every man, woman and child with financial
products to overcome the fundamental financial challenges that remain prevalent in many emerging
markets, both in Asia and elsewhere.
HelloGold is launching the Token Sale of HelloGold Tokens (HGT) to support the accelerated
development and the marketing of our financial inclusion agenda. I hope that you will find this
project worthy of your support.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
HelloGold has developed and launched a product to enable low to medium income customers to buy
and sell gold, anytime, anywhere. The System has customer mobile applications (native Android and
iOS) communicating with a backend built with 2 parts, a core Central Web Service (Ruby) and Agent
(Go). The current database uses Postgres technology.
Relevant parts of the backend are being migrated to Ethereum smart contracts to improve
transparency and security for the customer gold transactions, as well as increasing access to the
HelloGold system. HelloGold is using Ethereum as it is currently the most widely accepted platform
that offers all the benefits of a blockchain and multiple source language implementations that
encourage integration. Ethereum will handle only the parts needing consensus, transparency and
accountability. Other services will continue to be provided using existing technology. HelloGold is
using blockchain technology with a number of reconfigurable contracts that can be combined to
perform the necessary functions in such a way as to allow new capabilities to be added while
retaining the integrity of the entire system.
The Ethereum blockchain will be run on a private network to avoid paying infrastructure fees per
transaction, reduce transaction latency and avoid the risk of independent developers adding their
own contracts onto the HelloGold Blockchain.
HelloGold is now developing the blockchain elements, as opposed to leading with the smart
contracts, as the requirements and areas that need to maintain flexibility are clearer having iterated
using traditional technologies. The smart contracts are being prototyped and the test infrastructure
is in place. Next comes the integration with the current system which will be balanced between
immediate needs of the business and getting the blockchain to the market in a timely manner.
HelloGold plans to develop this platform to enable HelloGold customers to switch from HelloGold
customer gold to cryptocurrency tokens, backed by investment grade gold (Gold Backed Tokens GBT). These tokens will be based on Ethereum ERC20 tokens so they can complete the calculation
features required and make the gold tradeable on exchanges, outside the HelloGold system. As the
GBT will be fully backed by 1g of physical, investment grade (99.99%) gold, vaulted with HelloGold’s
vaulting provider, they should track the price of 1g gold. Critically, these blockchain elements will
provide liquidity via smart contracts, forming the basis to convert value between fiat, gold and
cryptocurrency, enabling gold as a form of value exchange.
Subject to a successful Token Sale of HGT by the HelloGold Foundation (HGF), it is envisaged that
HGF will give grants to HelloGold to support the development of HelloGold in the following ways:
1.
Market expansion
2.
Product improvement and technical development
3.
Tech team expansion – required to implement 1. and 2.
Depending on the level of funds raised by HGF, HelloGold will be able to accelerate the market and
product (functionality) expansion plans with a larger tech team.

HELLOGOLD TECHNOLOGY AND USE OF BLOCKCHAIN

PRODUCT OVERVIEW
HelloGold has developed a product to enable low and median income customers to buy and sell
gold, anytime, anywhere, using a mobile application. To do this, customers must register an account,
clear KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, top up the account with cash and then buy gold. Once
gold has been bought, customers can either physically redeem it, gift it to other HelloGold
users/accounts or take a loan using the gold as collateral, thereby reducing the cost of the loan.
Customers can sell the gold back to HelloGold at the market rate at the time of the transaction and
have the cash returned to them.

TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
HelloGold is currently using proven technology to deliver the core product of buying and selling gold.
The System has mobile applications (native Android and iOS) communicating with a backend built
with 2 parts, a core Central Web Service (Ruby) and Agent (Go). The current database uses Postgres
technology. HelloGold intend to migrate parts of the backend to Ethereum smart contracts to
improve transparency and security. In the future this will provide the basis for a gold backed
cryptocurrency.
Current HelloGold System

Mobile Applications
Two Native Mobile applications have been built for Android and iOS respectively. Native has been
used for speed, responsiveness, customer familiarity and to some extent better security due to
compiled binaries. The mobile application enables the following functionality:
1. Set up account (registering, clearing KYC)
2. Top Up “e-wallet” (add cash to HelloGold account)
3. Buy/Sell gold
4. Physically redeem gold
5. Apply for gold backed loan
6. Gift gold (remit gold to other people)
7. Cash withdrawal
Backend
HelloGold’s core system is built on Ruby-on-Rails and Go with a Postgres database backend. Ruby is
used for the CWS to give us faster time to market by exploiting the rich pool of available RoR
developers. Go is used to build the other components for connecting to other source systems due to
the rich tools for integration with the additional benefit of easily moving our solution to the
blockchain world as the Ethereum platform is built on Go. The 2 core components of HelloGold’s
System are:

1. Central Web Service (CWS): Built on Ruby-on-Rails (RoR), CWS provides the core interface
for HelloGold’s mobile applications and potentially third party applications. For resilience
purposes, CWS functions merely as an app server in which it does not interface directly with
any external parties but merely responds to requests via the APIs that it connects to and
delegating the integration to external parties via Agent (described below). Some of the core
functions of CWS are:
- Customer data including KYC (anti-money laundering system)
- Transaction functions such as customer buy, sell gold and transaction history
- Account Management
- Provide the mobile interfaces to Agent functions such as Top Up and gold redemption
- Calculation and charging of fees (Fee Engine)
- End of Day Customer, Accounting, Management Report generation
- Management panels (front-end) for customer support, accounting reporting.
2. Agent: Built on Go, Agent provides the core functions by integrating with external third party
service APIs such as payment gateway, currency exchange rates and gold bullion agent.
Using a purely micro-services architecture that promotes Agile development, the Agent can
be upgraded by bringing on additional services as required. Another benefit is that should an
external service fails, the Agent will handle it while ensuring that customer activity will not
be impacted. Key functions are:
- Cash functions – including Top Up and withdrawal
- Gold function – pricing, redemption
- Treasury – buy/sell gold
- International currency transfer including exchange rates
- UN Consolidated List – KYC search for banned customers
Database
The current implementation uses the Postgres database, a traditional Relational Database
Management System (RDBMS) for storing confidential client related data. The traditional database
model has been developed prior to the implementation of the blockchain to test the feasibility of
our approach and to ensure that the System could be responsive to changes. As the major business
and technical principles are now clearer, the relevant parts of the System can be migrated onto the
Blockchain whilst maintaining some flexibility to deal with future product changes.
Testing
HelloGold completes internal testing on the product, independent from the development team.
Additionally, HelloGold runs security audits on the product/System prior to any major release. The
System is set up with back-up capability/redundancy, which is tested on a regular basis.

PRODUCT BLOCKCHAIN
HelloGold will use Ethereum blockchain smart contracts to provide additional security and
transparency for the customer gold transactions, as well as increasing access to the HelloGold
system.
Transparency
By publishing the smart contracts and incorporating a blockchain explorer (transaction navigator), it
will be possible to review the full list of anonymised transactions and calculate the amount of gold
that HelloGold is holding on behalf of customers. This can be compared to the amount of gold

published in the customer gold list (anonymised) and that vaulted by HelloGold’s custodian, who
also independently publishes the total amount of gold held.
Security
HelloGold has incorporated several security mechanisms to protect customer accounts. All
connections are encrypted using HTTPS. Internal API calls between the core components are secured
with additional secret keys and firewall rules that limit interactions between trusted systems. For
external facing APIs, for example APIs used by our mobile application, the API calls are further
secured with a combination of industry standard OAUTH and secure tokens for each mobile device.
The addition of a distributed record adds a further level of security from internal and external
attempts to alter account data without leaving an audit trail. The smart contracts are being
developed with best practices in mind following constant review of public audit documents. This
should ensure that customer accounts are true and accurate.
Access
In addition, the Ethereum smart contracts will enable HelloGold to create ERC20 based GBT,
tradeable on any exchange which accepts them. This will make the HelloGold platform available to
everyone anywhere in the world
HelloGold System incorporating blockchain

CWS and Client Engine
When the blockchain is implemented, the core of the services as provided by CWS would essentially
remain the same to the external applications. The key difference is that some of the functions (for
example, Financial Transactions, Account Management, Fee Calculation) that were originally
implemented within the CWS but are now implemented in the blockchain would be delegated by the
CWS. The Client Engine would interface to the Contract Agent for all blockchain-related transactions.
However, for the functions that are still implemented in CWS (for example Customer KYC Data and
providing the Web Panels for Customer Support and Finance), these interactions would not go
through the Client Engine but instead would remain within the CWS core.

ETHEREUM
HelloGold is using Ethereum as it is currently the most widely accepted platform that offers all the
benefits of a blockchain (full traceability, non-repudiability etc.) and multiple source language
implementations that encourage integration. Ethereum will handle only the parts needing
consensus, transparency and accountability. Other services will continue to be provided using
existing technology.
HelloGold needs a transactional blockchain with a powerful system of smart contracts which have
the ability to ensure that a transaction can combine with the results of previous transactions to
provide auditable consistent results. To date, Ethereum is the only stable system that has achieved
widespread adoption. The decades of experience of our senior development team tell us to avoid
anything experimental to run a live system.
The Ethereum blockchain will be run on a private network to avoid paying infrastructure fees per
transaction, reduce transaction latency and avoid the risk of independent developers adding their
own contracts onto the HelloGold Blockchain. This means that HelloGold and the other nodes will
control the block times, ensuring customer gold transactions are completed efficiently. (Currently
the Kovan test-net seals blocks every four seconds)
Ether and Gas will continue to be used on the Private Net. Gas is an essential concept to ensure that
faulty code does not hang or throttle the throughput of the nodes. “Private Net Ether” will be either
mined by the nodes that require it, or distributed as needed.
Critically, the blockchain elements of the system will provide liquidity via smart contracts, forming
the basis to convert value between fiat, gold and cryptocurrency, enabling gold as a form of value
exchange.
BLOCKCHAIN DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
HelloGold is using blockchain technology with a number of reconfigurable contracts that can be
combined to perform the necessary functions in such a way as to allow new capabilities to be added
while retaining the integrity of the entire system. To attain this, the principle objects (the user and
company accounts) are designed to survive intact even when details of the business operations may
change, hence they were isolated into general purpose contracts. Other contracts such as Gifts,
Loans and the Fee Engine are designed to be able to be plugged in and changed/updated as
required.
The network as designed should be able to scale because it is not a high speed trading application
and therefore not transaction heavy. One account holder is expected to be transacting several times
per month rather than hourly/daily. By the time we find that there is a congestion issue, the warning
signs will have been there for some time and we will have had time to address them.
In any system development, we need to pull together a number of technologies as appropriate. It is
our firm belief that a UTXO (value transaction) blockchain has value as a tool in the appropriate
system. A UTXO system is not appropriate for the HelloGold system as we need smart contracts
which can manage transaction calculations. Things which can validly be done off chain should be
done off chain. Where consensus is required for auditability, it should be done on-chain or proofs
stored on chain. We have a consensus system of competing interests even in our systems design.

HelloGold is now developing the blockchain elements, as opposed to leading with the smart
contracts, as the requirements and areas that need to maintain flexibility are clearer having iterated
on the Contract Agent (using Go). While the system that we have designed is still in the early stages,
we are testing it for efficiency and auditability. We are doing it with input from experienced staff in
each area who has to convince the others that his way is the correct way of doing something.
SMART CONTRACT SYSTEM
Smart contracts

Contract Agent
The Contract Agent is a Go server which acts as a firewall to prevent direct access to the Private Net
thereby ensuring its integrity and availability. This firewall should prevent spam attacks on the
Private Net (as recently occurred on the Ropsten testnet - possible because of the low cost of Ether
on a private net). We will also examine other schemes such as PoA (as just released in Kovan) and
Permissioned Blockchain implementations for further protection of the net.
When the HelloGold mobile app creates a transaction, the app/user signs the transactions. The
Contract Agent server then dispatches/submits that transaction (job) onto the Private Net.
Smart Contract Gateway
The Smart Contract Gateway manages the relationship between contracts and acts as a gateway to
the other contracts in the system. The main HelloGold contract has 2 functions – broker for some
and index of where to find the contracts for other transactions (e.g. where to find a bank contract
for a new currency). Additionally, the Gateway contract maintains the HelloGold gold balance. This
excludes client gold, but includes fees that have been charged in gold. This contract has been
designed as upgradeable without impacting the client account contracts (transactions). This is to
minimise the need to migrate the client accounts in future.
Bank Contracts
Bank contracts are a series of smart contracts, with one per country in which HelloGold operates,
plus functions to allow who can access and update that list. Initially this is Malaysia only, but will
include other countries as HelloGold expands. The contract maintains transactions relating to
HelloGold’s cash operations in that country, including the cash in/out functions. The record

11

maintains HelloGold money only, not client cash. The contract accepts cash to enable buy/sell gold
transactions.
Users’ Accounts
Users’ Accounts processes and records customer related transactions in a series of arrays in a smart
contract, holding:
1. customer cash and gold balances
2. the current fee tier for transactions
3. a list of gifts and loans for each customer, showing status for each (open or closed)
Fee Tables
The Fee contract includes a list of tiers outlining the different fee structures that could apply to a
customer. Whilst this is initially consistent across all customers, flexibility has been built in to enable
variations in fees in future either due to promotions, variations by country, or other currently
unknown variables.
Gifting
Each gift creates a new smart contract based on a template, with each contract implementing the
movement of gold from account A to B, plus the status of that movement - complete, in progress,
rejected (inc timed out). The flexibility incorporated into this design will enable broader use beyond
pure “gifting”, i.e. anytime a transfer of gold between accounts is required.
Loans
Each loan is represented by a smart contract and comprises an agreement between customer and
agent. As the current structure of the loan products has not been confirmed, less has been defined
in these contracts beyond the ability to lock the customer gold as collateral for the duration of the
loan and the ability to release this collateral at the end of the term. The architecture means we can
create new types of loans for different environments.
All the smart contracts have been designed so that they can be updated without effecting the
balances, e.g. to allow HelloGold to add new currencies, countries, fee structures, loan products,
other products not yet known. Contracts include information based on what is required only, rather
than all information.
CURRENT STATUS
The smart contracts are being prototyped and the test infrastructure is in place. Next comes
planning the integration with the current system which will be balanced between immediate needs
of the business and getting the blockchain to the market in a timely manner. This will include a
migration from Postgres to smart contracts. Since HelloGold is a working business, rollout will
proceed cautiously with a parallel run to ensure that the system is processing transactions correctly.
Part of the process will be extensive validation testing and an independent security audit of the
contracts. Ideally we will be working in parallel by end October (2017) and completely on the
blockchain by end Q4
GOLD BACKED TOKENS
The current use of blockchain is to support the core product (buy/sell/store gold). HelloGold plans to
develop this platform to enable HelloGold customers to switch from HelloGold customer gold to
cryptocurrency tokens, backed by investment grade gold (GBT). These tokens will be based on

HelloGold Foundation Limited.

12

Ethereum ERC20 tokens and be fully backed by 1g of physical, investment grade (99.99%) gold,
vaulted with HelloGold’s vaulting provider. Consequently, GBT should track the price of 1g gold.
GBT utilises ERC20 tokens so they can complete the calculation features required autonomously.
This will make the gold tradeable on exchanges that accept the tokens, outside the HelloGold
system.
Once the GBT have been developed, they will be available for direct sales, to provide a version of a
stable coin for crypto investors. Holders of the cryptocurrency gold backed tokens will be able to
switch to a physical gold account and be able to either redeem physical gold or withdraw fiat
currency via the existing HelloGold System.
HGF will pay a management fee to HelloGold to cover the management costs associated with the
GBT being physically backed by 99.99% investment grade gold. The management fee charged will be
consistent with HelloGold customer account charges. This is currently set at 2% per annum,
calculated daily and charged monthly. HGF anticipate that the charge will remain the same as that
charged to HelloGold customer accounts. Therefore, the charge may change either up or down,
although HelloGold does not currently anticipate this. The calculation and payment will be
incorporated into the GBT smart contract. This management fee will be paid in gold by HGF to
HelloGold.
Via GBT, HelloGold will create a link between fiat currency, gold, gold as a cryptocurrency and other
cryptocurrencies; with the ability to transfer value along through the blockchain.
For additional information on GBT and how they operate, please see Token Sale Information Sheet.
RISK MITIGATION – USING A PRIVATE NET
HelloGold will be running on a private blockchain - with restricted access. Transactions on the
Private Net will be allowed on a role based permission model. The version that the nodes are
running will only be upgraded as required after extensive tests. The interface between the Private
Net and the Live Net will be one way, as will the explorer. Should Ethereum cease to operate as a
public net, the Private Net can continue operation until a suitable replacement is found.

For information on HGT and GBT, please refer to Token Sale Information Sheet

13

The Bridge Node will be a server allowing the Ethereum private network to communicate with the
public Ethereum network and vice versa using event logs to trigger the communication activities.
Such an approach is already proven to be effective by the Oraclize platform.
SECURITY AUDIT
Security audits have been run on the core product – apps, communications and backend. This will be
repeated on a regular basis, including prior to the blockchain deployment to ensure the integrity of
the smart contracts. These have been done by reputable third parties including Crysp Australia Pty
Ltd.
The smart contracts themselves will be audited via a reputable third party at the appropriate time.
At this time there are a number of alternatives that we are looking to complete the work. Funds will
be set aside to pay for these reviews as required prior to any deployment and parallel run.

EXPANSION PLANS

DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP
BUSINESS PLAN
Once the core gold buy/sell/store/transfer mechanism is in place, and scale achieved (thereby
reducing marginal costs), there are many uses for the core functionality. The HelloGold team have
built a strategy to utilise the core technology and to expand its use in different markets, segments,
assets, products with different partners, as well as expand the types of technology used as required.
Not least, this includes expanding the traditional world operations to support the gold backed tokens
in the cryptocurrency market. HelloGold are able to immediately adapt the solutions used for the
core product (app) and apply these to the crypto market in conjunction with Ethereum smart
contracts and ERC20 tokens.

DEVELOPMENT FUNDS
Subject to a successful Token Sale of HGT by HGF, it is envisaged that HGF will give grants to
HelloGold to support the development of HelloGold in the following ways:
1. Market expansion
2. Product improvement and technical development
3. Tech team expansion – required to implement 1. and 2.
1. MARKET EXPANSION
The key drivers of HelloGold AUM are number of customers and amount of gold held by each
customer. The best way to increase the number of active customers is via expansion into new
geographic markets. The grants received from HGF (if any) will determine which markets can be
entered, and accelerate the entry into these markets.
Market expansion will require spend in 4 key areas:
1. In country teams – Set up and run incountry operations, including local customer
service and marketing (language driven)
2. Tech team – Scale up the tech team to get
in-house specialists and the ability to
respond to the challenges of both
development and operating in multiple
countries. This will include creating versions
of the app for different countries
(internationalisation inc. language, country
specific payment systems, changes caused
by different regulatory environments,
different cultures, partner requirements etc)
3. Marketing – Due to the mass market nature
of the product, country specific marketing
(style, content, language) is critical to
creating product acceptance and take up.
Expanding into different countries will
require additional headcount for digital
marketing (inc social media management in
local languages)
4. Additional overhead, particularly working
capital required for a larger gold float (gold
available for sale)
Note: HelloGold’s expansion has costs in base/local currency (not crypto) and therefore the ability to
accelerate our expansion and grow AUM is determined by the base currency amount
raised/equivalent when ETH is released.

issues
High Availability active-active nodes that
provide maximum uptime
Self-diagnostic health check system with the
ability to provide early warning alerts of
potential problems

*Extended payment options include debit card, bank payment systems, tenpay, alipay, mobile wallet
and crypto-currency exchange integration.
Year 2 and 3
The focus for 2018 and 2019 will be as per the Business Roadmap, with a focus on expanding into
new markets (Indonesia, China, Philippines) and new products.
HelloGold will develop a detailed ‘use of funds’ prior to undertaking any new financing, including but
not limited to the receipt of any future grants from HGF.
3. TEAM EXPANSION
HelloGold would like to be able to expand the technical team to support the development roadmap
both in terms of markets entered, technical features and product functions. Currently the team are
technical generalists who are applied to solve all the technical problems HelloGold encounters.
Ideally we would like to bring more capability in-house, to increase responsiveness/speed to market
and control/quality, and get specialists (to ensure best practice):
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.

In house app developers, both Android and iOS
Systems engineers for core Ruby and Go infrastructure
Blockchain team – reduce key man risk and have ongoing smart contract development
Specialist technical in-house testing, including ability to write automated test scripts as well
as manual testing. Security testing would remain an outsourced function
Dev Ops to manage the transition from development to operations
Tech Ops team to support product operations/customer service, reducing the
time/distraction on developers (both app and systems engineers)
Business Analyst, Product Development Lead, Technical Architects and Technical Writers to
provide more streamlined development and better documentation of common
architecture/processes.
Technical marketing support. As marketing becomes increasingly technical (e.g. in app
analytics tools, push notifications, tracking, social media etc), the skill set required for
marketing becomes more technical. Rather than relying on the development team (or even
Tech Ops) to provide this technical support, HelloGold would like to build a team of technical
marketing specialists to drive the growth in AUM.

BUDGET
HelloGold has produced an expected operating budget based on anticipated Year 1 and Year 3
spend.
HelloGold 3-Year Budget

The change in percentage of each segment between Year 1 and Year 3 reflects the relative costs of
expanding into new markets.
Team covers employment (staff) costs. HelloGold will expand our tech team and set up operational
and marketing staff in new markets. The team cost as a portion of total reduces over time, as
HelloGold will be able to benefit from scale.
Gold Capex is the working capital cost of buying and storing gold reserves. With increased scale, the
gold reserves will make up a smaller portion of total costs compared to setting up operations in new
markets.
Marketing covers direct to market activities, supporting integration with business partners, and
promotions. As HelloGold enters new, larger markets we will increase our marketing spend
accordingly.

Office includes expenses used to run HelloGold offices and related administrative costs, more people
in more locations leads to increased spend.
Architecture refers to the cost of maintaining and improving tech systems, including mobile
development and web services.
Security Audit means third party auditing of HelloGold systems.
Non-Gold Capex covers fixed assets including computer and mobile phone hardware.
Other captures all other third party fees including legal services, Shariah advisory and licensing.
Contingency is calculated as a percentage of the total budget. Over time, HelloGold will allocate
more finances towards this fund (up to 10%) as the bigger expansion plan will have greater
uncertainty and more “unknown unknowns” which may require funds.
USE OF FUNDS
Depending on the funds raised by HGF, HelloGold will be able to accelerate the market and product
(functionality) expansion plans with a larger tech team.

Community Support
As part of the Token Sale, HGF has set aside some tokens as a community fund to say thank you to
some of the people running unpaid services, who put in large amounts of time that the rest of the
community don’t see, and the rest of us taking them for granted. This will be distributed to causes
determined by HGF membership after the Token Sale.

REPORTING
Project Plan
HelloGold intends to produce a written update on each fortnight on progress towards the expansion
goals outlined in the ‘Development Funds’, and announce when significant milestones are reached.
This will be in the form of a blog on Medium, covering both technical and business issues.
AUM reporting
The key metric required to measure success is AUM held by HelloGold. As outlined in the Token Sale
Information Sheet, it will be possible to view the amount of AUM held by HelloGold via multiple
mechanisms, including the publication on HelloGold website showing anonymised customer
balances and gold held in storage by HelloGold on behalf of customers. This information is
automatically updated each day and can be found at https://www.hellogold.com/how-it-works/
(scroll down to Security). Once the smart contracts are live and the blockchain explorer in place
(securely) this will enable further direct, real time verification. Additionally, HGF will publish
supporting material each month to show the calculation behind endowment level and the GBT
released that month.
These updates (or links to the source) will be posted on the Token Sale channels listed below.

Android and iOS apps are available in the Play/App store respectively. Due to the KYC/AML take on
process, the HelloGold app currently requires a Malaysian MyKad for identity verification and entry
to use the app functionality. For non-Malaysians who would like to view a demo version of the app,
an Android version can be https://www.hellogold.org/code-review.html including instructions on
how to clear the verification steps. Please note that the demo app has test accounts only and include
automated elements; no real cash/gold will be transacted. For iOS users, please use an Android
simulator on your laptop to view this APK.
