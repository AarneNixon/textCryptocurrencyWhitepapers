Introduction

Crypto is
difficult,
but it
shouldn’t
be.

INTRODUCTION
FSFSFS

Today's cryptocurrency and digital asset activities are already a growing reality and
will increasingly become an integral part of our daily lives. The world as we know it is in
a state of constant and accelerated change. The ability to have borderless commerce
and communication through the internet has already caused an immeasurable change
in the way individuals handle their lives, finance and security. As this digital trend
deepens, everyone independent of origin or social status will be given the empowering
opportunity to participate in decentralized digital economies powered by blockchain
technology and cryptocurrencies.

Decentralized economies powered by cryptocurrencies enable people and businesses
to conduct trustless, anonymous and secure transactions across national borders.
New opportunities for retail, entertainment, finance and essentially anything else
that a person might want to spend fiat currency on, are already available in this digital
economy today.

Today we would like to introduce you to Klever. Klever is that trusted gateway for
blockchain and the emerging decentralized economy, by providing a safer, faster
and smarter cryptocurrency experience for all users to enter and thrive in this new
decentralized economy. Guided by an integrated and dynamic thinking, our blockchain
platform allows users to have access to countless products and services that are
indispensable on a daily basis, including crypto wallet, currency swap, web browser,
exchange, staking, and payment channels and more.

INTRODUCTION
FSFSFSRAT

Klever was designed to solve two big issues in
crypto today. The crypto security problem and
the user experience problem.

Klever is composed of 4 elements:

Klever OS

Klever Exchange

Klever App

Klever Labs

FSFSFS
KLEVER
OS

01

Klever OS

Today's major mobile crypto wallets on the market are great, but as we learn more
about crypto and its associated risks, we feel less secure about it. Wouldn't it be great
if there were a wallet you can always trust? Well, we're doing just that and it’s called
Klever OS.

Klever OS is a groundbreaking wallet
operating system that enables developers of
all platforms to run a smart and secure wallet
inside their apps, cloud, servers, hardware,
smartphones, pen drives, mobile devices and
wearables.

Klever OS rethinks and rebuilds the core wallet system to replace crypto wallet
solutions and bring to the user advanced security on a completely new level. A simple
sdk library that automatically extends your app to organize and protect all your secret
information on your device of choice.

APP

Klever App

FSFSFSRAT
KLEVER
APP

9

Klever is the first app built on top of Klever OS. On the Klever app we are building an
ecosystem where our users have access to countless useful products and services,
which are today limited or unavailable in other wallets. Wouldn't it be great if users
could be able to sell and buy crypto, play games and utilize decentralized finance
solutions, make travel bookings and do shopping online, all in a seamless and secure
manner with full anonymity and protected privacy?

That is Klever.
On the Klever app we constantly explore what new kinds of services and products
we should bring to the wallet in order to meet the desires and increasing demands of
our growing global user base. This way, the demanded products and services will be
offered in several categories, bringing friendly crypto solutions to our users.

Users worldwide

250,000

Our experience is taken from the building of TronWallet, our
previous app that caters over 250,000 users globally. With
over 30k daily active users (DAU), TronWallet has grown
to become one of the most used blockchain applications

Daily Active Users (DAU)

30,000

in the entire crypto space. Klever will become TronWallet’s
new, expanded and more advanced home.

FSFSFS
KLEVER EXCHANGE

10

03

Klever Swap
and Exchange

The cryptocurrency Swap is a major feature and use case
for Klever and its ecosystem of apps. Our Swap enables
Klever users to directly swap one coin or token to another,
from one blockchain to another (e.g. BTC to TRX or ETH)
with high security, full privacy and unrivaled speed.

11

FSFSFSRAT
KLEVER EXCHANGE

The aim behind the Swap is to make it simpler, faster and more convenient for our
users to exchange crypto currencies. By monitoring live price action on top-tier
exchanges, our engine creates a price index that is used by the Swap. When a user
goes to the Swap screen on the Klever app, they will see the default Swap pair from
BTC (BTC) to USDT (USDT). The user then can make a quote to check the price
prediction offer, select a new token pair to quote as well as type the amount he/she
wants to swap.

The swap itself is conducted by fully autonomous bots, built in-house, which
continuously seek the best exchange rate and prices among the top exchanges, and
then execute the Swap with high precision, security and speed. Klever Swap project is
part of Klever Exchange.

Klever Spot Exchange was designed for both beginners and advanced
traders. Using the latest gRPC technology, we have built one of the most
advanced crypto currency exchanges in the world, which is capable of
providing superior security and intuitive user experience, and able to
support 1M+ transactions per second.

FSFSFS
KLEVER
LABS

12

04

Klever Labs

This is one of the most interesting platforms
we are working on, which is set to launch in
Q3 of 2020.
In order to develop superior solutions and
apps we draw expertise from our own
experience of many years of blockchain
and software architecture development.
We will field and introduce major
groundbreaking projects that bring simple
and accessible solutions to the wallet and
other Klever apps; products that are the
result of creativity, extensive research and
an excellent team that has honed its skills
over the past decade. The result will be
innovation with usability and purpose.

Klever is the new home for blockchain
innovation.

Each project developed by Klever Labs will
be crowdfunded with KLV token using the
following structure:
1. Projects will accept the KLV token inside the application.
2. Users can participate in projects by purchasing the token during each
crowdfunding session.
3. Users can participate in crowdfunding using BTC, ETH, TRX, USDT and KLV tokens.
4. The tokens (BTC, ETH, TRX, USDT) received from crowdfunding will be converted at
market price to KLV and distributed to projects at the end crowdfund event.
5. Projects may offer rewards to VIP members.

FSFSFS
KLEVER
COIN

14

05

Klever Coin (KLV)

We believe that having a utility token that powers all of our products and services
brings credibility, agility, accountability and independence to our users. It strengthens
our relationship with our community and enables dynamic partnership deals. All
transactions carried out in the portfolio of apps go through the KLV coin, directly
or indirectly. KLV is the link between our users and the products and services in the
portfolio. We will do a permanent and continuous job to strengthen this link, since this
is what connects us with our users and grows the ecosystem.

You can use KLV coin
on our platform to:
•

Stake

•

Pay transaction fees

•

Pay exchange fees

•

Pay Swap fees

•

Reduce exchange fees

•

Reduce Swap fees

•

Make p2p payments

•

Buy VIP token

•

Participate in new projects through crowdfunding

A strict limit of 10B KLV will be created.

FSFSFSRAT
KLEVER
COIN

15

Klever Coin is the evolution of TWX token and it will convert TWX to KLV 1:1 without
any increase of the max supply of 10B tokens. The token swap will be conducted
seamlessly in our wallet’s built-in Swap. Since the beginning of the journey of TWX, we
have reduced the max supply from 30B tokens to 10B tokens by burning more than
67% of all tokens. To reiterate, KLV will maintain the same max supply of 10B.

• KLV Burn
Every week we will burn KLV based on the KLV swap fees collected on our crypto-tocrypto swap platform. All transactions will be recorded on the blockchain. A total of
5B KLV tokens will be destroyed using this mechanism and thereby removed from the
KLV supply.

• KLV Staking
The KLV Staking feature will increase the current circulating supply by using an
inflationary smart contract. The inflation goal is to reward users that are staking KLV
to support the project. The inflation will vary using the table below.

RISKS/COMPETITION

20

07

Risks

There is no innovation without risks. There is no innovation without mistakes. There
is no innovation without learning from these mistakes. There are many risks involved
in building applications in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries. We at Klever
have the skills, experience, vision, teamwork and leadership to face these challenges
and overcome these risks.

08

Competition

The real competition is met within ourselves. The true competition is to understand
what went wrong and transform into something better, learn from our own mistakes.
What makes us unique in the space is that we have already launched, developed,
grown and updated a crypto wallet that is used by over 80k users each month and is
installed on more than 250k devices worldwide.

The competition in this space is fierce, but our emphasis will not lie with other crypto
projects - instead we are confident that our ethics, experience, roadmap, partnership
network, technical prowess, superior marketing, innovative products and most
importantly our team make us uniquely positioned to grab a good chunk of the crypto
market share.

21

09

FUTURE

Future

Klever will in the future be implementing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning tools to assist users to become smarter and more informed investors.

The future is a world of endless opportunities and technology allows us to build
fantastic paths, unimaginable in the past. The innovative pace allows us to “break
barriers” and build on the new standard of normal. This construction will be relevant
if it is connected to the needs and desires of our community of users. Strengthening
each link for the common good. We believe that some technologies that are under
development will enable major evolutions in our relationships and we will dedicate
ourselves to honing these products in the coming years.
