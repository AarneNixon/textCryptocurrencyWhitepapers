Summary
There are 1 bln sites in the world and the number is growing by 5-7%
annually. However, only 3% of them use share buttons – only 30 mln sites.
With over 3 bln people using social networks, of which 10% are active
users, the social network advertising spending is expected to grow up
to $50 billion in 2019. The most popular users in social networks, for
example, top Instagram influencers, have been earning money using their
popularity through social network advertising.
Sharpay will help all the social active users to monetize their popularity
by earning crypto currency.
Sharpay is a unique technological and very simple share button. Sites
put the button under any content instead of other old sharing buttons
and users get rewards for sharing. The system has fraud protection, bot
defense with audience targeting possibility based on CPV (cost per visit)
payments.
The innovation of Sharpay — blockchain rewards for sharing with tokens
and multisharing — sharing in several networks with one click.This is a
unique project, that has simultanioulsy the two possibilities. The
technology is protected by the Eurasian international patent priority.
Sharpay — is a new SMM instrument for increasing traffic, conversions,
sessions and sales with less spends.
Spreading the Sharpay technology will increase the agregated sharing
from 3% to 10% in the world. Sharpay plans to get 50% of that growth
that is equal to 35% of international market in general.
Sharpay will quarterly reserve 90% of the proceeds to ensure the
redemption of tokens from their holders (investors and users). The
program starts according to the results of the 3rd quarter of 2018. The
price of the buyback is based on the nominal price of a token at 0.00003
ETH which is approximately equal to $0.01 at the time of the official
launch of the project in November, 2017.
Sharpay’s tokens are initially released on Ethereum according to the
ERC20 standard, are the blockchain is used as a financial registry. At the
next stage of development of Sharpay, we are going to develop and
launch an independent decentralized blockchain system (BitShares fork
3

with a POS-basis), followed by the migration of tokens - the blockchain
will be used for issuing, distributing tokens between sites and users for
social activity, and storing the information.
Starting from the second stage, the rewards from the blockchain will gain
not only more users, but also more sites to install Sharpay button.

Market
People have always been sharing news, thoughts and ideas. A switch to
online communication has significantly increased the number of people
engaged in information exchange process as well as the volume of content
being distributed. Today, any Internet project by all means wants to
increase its appearance through different potential traffic sources, such
as blogs, social media and forums. Visitor flow is money, reputation and
business growth. Posting content in the social space is an integral part
of search engine optimization. The number of platforms in the Internet
engaged in social communications through information sharing increases
every day. It’s already hard to imagine our life without this tool. We
communicate, get acquainted with each other, promote our business, read
news by sharing.
Content sharing from websites to user pages on the social media appeared
more than 10 years ago when Facebook, Twitter, VKontakte etc. became
popular all over the world. Initially based on open social media API, this
technology was at the same time caught up by independent start-up
companies making it popular through aggregation of API of various social
media into one and the same unit of share buttons with additional settings
(customization) for independent website developers and users. After
a while, AddThis.com, ShareThis.com, AddToAny.com, Pluso.ru
became the most known and successful share aggregators in terms of its
market share position.
Currently, there are around 1 billion websites in the world and the number
is growing by 5-7% per year in average. Share aggregators’ buttons
can only be found on no more than 3% (30 million) of websites from
this amount. The competitors have the following shares in the market

Subject
It’s been more than ten years since social media, share buttons
and aggregators appeared in the market, but the traditional sharing
technology has not actually changed. This is, however, strange for the
fast-growing market of Internet solutions.

Traditional sharing: sharing action repeated for each new social media

6

Why hasn’t traditional sharing been developing? Because IT-companies
don’t see any great economical value working on this tool — monetizing
methods have been limited for this technology. The first blockchain-based
technologies may give a powerful impetus to the development of Internet
advertisement through sharing.

Sharpay Solution
Sharpay is a share button of the next generation, which allows for oneclick distribution of the content on social media with targeting and reward
for click-through. As opposed to traditional analogues, Sharpay provides
multisharing of information, i.e. it makes it possible for users to oneclick post the content on their pages on multiple social media at a time.
Information posting becomes more convenient; moreover, after sharing
each user gets blockchain-based tokens.
Sharpay is a new simple hi-tech blockchain-based SMM-tool for websites
with embedded economic model of process incentive. Sharpay button
extends traditional digital marketing battery and gives new possibilities
for digital content, goods and services promotion. Sharpay ensures
effective promotion of content on the Internet with targeting of viewers,
rewards for click-through of the visitors corresponding to the established
parameters and anti-cheat system.
Websites using Sharpay will significantly increase their site traffic
and sales conversion. Users clicking Sharpay buttons and distributing
websites’ content will get a fair payment for being active on social media
and for the click-thoughs on the posted links by their subscribers: the
more subscribers and click-throughs — the higher the reward gained by
the user who shared the link.

7

Websites distributing content are interested in activeness of popular
users who have millions of subscribers, but their interaction is often
spontaneous (such as in Instagram). Sharpay provides the market with
the new instrument, which makes counter-activity systematic. End users
are essentially the main beneficiaries of Sharpay.
Sharpay as it is, makes the market generally better.It simplified the way
various economic agents to find and communicate with each other, and
the information of products and services will be distributed faster than
ever.
With all the above-listed multiplied by technological leap due to blockchain
popularization and tokenization of the old technologies, the window
for revolutionary possibilities for creation, development and success of
Sharpay project is opened.

How the button looks like
The sharpay button can look like anything, for example, like on this page,
or it can be customized for the design of the site. The sharpay button can
be in any color and be the logos of any social networks. The main feature
of the button is the code, which is activated when you click on the button.
We can also use your own design and match it with out code.

Now Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, VK, Reddit, Telegram, Tumblr are already
connected to the multisharing of the working version of the sharpay
button. You can also copy a direct unique link and share it yourself on
forums, blogs and in comments.
We are working on connecting new social networks, like WeChat, Weibo,
QQ, G +, Viber, LiveJournal and others.

Sharpay Mission and Formula
The mission of Sharpay is to provide both websites and users of
social media with the new, mutually beneficial, convenient, automated
instrument for the promotion of content and goods. For the websites: to
increase their content (information and goods) distribution conversions;
and for the users: to get rewards (i.e. gaining digital tokens) by
distributing the content using a simple multsharing button.
You share — we pay.
Sharing is the new mining.
Get your Sharpay!
Multisharing + Its stimulation by tokens = increase in conversion
of websites’ content distribution on social media, websites’
traffic and internal KPI growing (number of active users, views,
registrations, sales etc.) + Convenience and possibility of gaining
tokens for the users (digital currency, crypto-currency).

Technology description
Sharpay project system is based on the synthesis of blockchain
technology designed for system transparency and economic incentive of
content promotion by means of tokens and multiaggregated API of the
most of the leading world-wide social media and messengers (Facebook,
Twitter, VKontakte etc.) designed for content distribution (multisharing).

System Functioning Model
Step 1.

Website company/owner buys Sharpay token package, for
example, 100 tokens (for $1), and sets targeting - who will be
rewarded with tokens for sharing/multisharing its content and
the click-through rewards setting etc.

Step 2.

Users start to share content on their pages on social media,
forums, blogs, and messengers.

Step 3.

Sharpay user account is automatically created after the first
time the user shares the content through Sharpay button upon
his/her agreement. Every user gets his/her rating within the
system by means of Sharpay scoring system (depending on the
number of friends, quality of subscribers, user activeness etc.).
Tokens are charged depending on the rating and the number of
further click-throughs on the link posted by targeted visitors.
There are four types of rating provided for in the basic solution
(zero, low, middle, high).

Step 4.

Tokens are charged to the website’s account immediately after
the users shared its content (if the website rewards users tokens
not only for click-throughs but for sharing as well) and are put
on hold for 24 hours. Moreover, the user is rewarded with tokens
for click-throughs on the link distributed in accordance with the
targeting parameters set by the website.

Step 5.

Sharpay automatically checks the availability of shared content
on the pages of users (for it not to be deleted) within 24 hours,
counts click-throughs, checks quality of visitors.

Step 6.

In case of positive check result (content is available on social
media, click-throughs are in accordance with quality), award
will be precisely calculated by the system and the tokens (on
10

hold) will be released to the users accordingly. In case the result
is negative, tokens (on hold) will be returned to the website’s
account.
Schematically, system functioning algorithm may be displayed as the
following sequence:

The user goes
to any* website

Sees interesting content

Clicks the sharpay
multi-sharing button

The share-window opens
for comment

The user writes a comment and chooses social media
to share the link to a website with his/her comment

The user has
a sharpay.io account

The user doesn't have a
sharpay.io account

Connected social media
are active for sharing

Social media are not active

The user shares the content
in the social media**

The user activates (OAuth)
social media

Posted**

A sharpay.io account
is created automatically

sharpay.io Antibot verifies the user's social media rating
according to its own scoring model

User's rating
is positive

User's rating
is negative

The user gets our tokens

Tokens are frozen
for 24 hours

sharpay.io antibot verifies the availability of the posted link
to a website on the user's page during 24 hours

Link to the website is saved

Link to the website is deleted

Accrued tokens unfrozen

Tokens returned
to the website

The user goes to sharpay.io

Withdraws tokens

* The user goes to any website; sees interesting content — the Internet user’s visit to any website,
which installed our Sharpay multisharing button instead of all conventional share-buttons
** The user shares the content in the social media — the user posted a link to interesting content
on his/her social media pages (one or multiple to choose)

11

Owners of Sharpay tokens may sell them in the exchange market or
offer them for mandatory repurchase by Sharpay at the price set in the
repurchase program.
Possibility of conversion of Sharpay tokens into another cryto-currencies
or currencies will depend upon the level of exchange market development.
The user will have a scoring range for each social media, therefore, the
amount of tokens being rewarded to the user for each multisharing will
be depended on his/her total scoring range and correspondence between
visitors clicking through the link and the targeting set by the website.
Example 1: if the user distributes website’s content in three social
media in one click, he/she will be rewarded with 3 tokens. The
amount of tokens is varied by the score of each social media, for
example, 2 tokens for each FB and TW and 1 token for VK, 5 tokens
in total.
Example 2: let’s say the website got 28 shares for 100 tokens
purchased. 15 of them are qualitative (i.e. qualitative to the minimum
for 1 token) and 13 are of higher class — of high quality (middle and
high).
Thus, the value of one token is equal to the value of one minimally
effective (qualitative) share (hereinafter, minimal effective share).
Website may gain 10,000 shares for 100 tokens, but there will be no more
than 100 effective (paid-for) ones among them.
1 minimal effective share = 1 Sharpay token = 0.00003 ETH, that is
approximately equal to $0.01 at the time of the official launch of the
project in November, 2017.
Sharpay is being updated at present. In the basic version of the project,
the tokens can only be charged for sharing. IIn the updated version, the
tokens can be charged for both sharing/multisharing and click-throughs.
The system will be able to check the availability of the shared content on
user’s pages; and the website will be able to choose whether to pay token
for sharing/ multisharing and click-throughs together or separately.
User who shares link of the content will be rewarded with tokens in
accordance with three indices combined:
• number of click-throughs,

12

• targeting (who shared),
• targeting (who clicked the link).

Technological features
To optimize the work of the Sharpay project, the system has a number of
technological features:
•

easy integration: Sharpay multisharing buttons can be easily
integrated into any Internet websites that are open to the integration of
a third-party API, which means that millions of websites can install and
activate Sharpay buttons in less than 30 minutes

•

built-in targeting: websites that have installed Sharpay buttons
will be able to target users — both sharing the content and following
links — to optimize the amount of tokens being payout (tokens accrual
to users) and fair charging of tokens, for example, only for goes that
correspond the necessary criteria

• «Social capital»: users «sharing» content through the Sharpay
buttons, will be automatically evaluated and ranked within the Sharpay
system, depending on the level of their activity on social media
(number of friends / subscribers, the number of publications/reposts,
etc.), which will affect the amount of tokens being rewarded to each
particular user, reliably protecting websites from bots, but providing an
opportunity for popular users to receive decent high reward.
•

protection from fraud: to avoid abuse, the system has a mechanism
to protect against bots and advertising fraud, limiting the number and
size of multisharing paid per the day / week / month — will effectively
counter the cheaters

•

ease-to-use: the basic user, in order to start «multisharing» content
using the Sharpay buttons installed on any different websites, does
not need to learn anything new and immerse himself in the world of
blockchain, tokens and crypto-technologies — at the first stage, the
user makes familiar actions to spread the interesting content (same as
with old sharing buttons), with only the difference of the appearance
of multisharing, now it’s easier and faster, plus, the user will see his/
her growing balance of tokens in the system, which in the future, at
a conscious transition to the next stage of cooperation with Sharpay
system, will give the user the opportunity to receive a personal private
key and access to the balance, to transfer tokens to cryptocurrency
exchange and/or withdraw fiat.
13

The principle of operation, installation,
convenience for websites
To successfully integrate and use the Sharpay multisharing buttons,
websites need just a few clicks to get the button code with a personal
unique identifier, set this code on the pages of their website, removing
all old-generation button codes of the usual sharing. After that, the
button is ready for use by users (site visitors) for content distribution and
promotion.

* Clicked the personal account in sharpay.io — all actions in the personal account in sharpay.io
are carried out by the sire owner or website administrator (manager), if he has appropriate
instructions or authority.

14

Multisharing, user convenience
Users (site visitors), can now easily <<share>> interesting content from
the website to their pages on social media by clicking on the Sharpay
multisharing button, which has no difference from the old generation
sharing button in appearance and customization.
(In one of the button customizing options, it is possible to display the
digital balance of tokens directly on the button, with a crypto currency
Token Sale, which will attract users to click on the Sharpay button and
distribute content).
If the users are interested in distributing interesting content of the
website, they can click <<share>> to activate the Sharpay button, a
pop-up window will be appeared and they can write a comment on the
content and choose the social media to share on.
The peculiarity and convenience of multisharing are that they can choose
more than one social media to share on with a comment by clicking on the
<<Send>> button.
It should be noted thatat the first activation of any social media in this
process, a personal account with an electronic wallet inside Sharpay
will be automatically created for the user, to which the user can access
at any time using Oauth-authorization, without the need to enter a login
/ password. When the project is transitioned to a blockchain, the user
will receive a private key (one private key for one account) from his/her
wallet).

15

* The user goes to any site – the user’s redirection online to any site that has already installed the
sharpay multisharing button, instead of all the usual share-buttons
** Clicks the animated sharpay button – at the time of the first sharing, the user automatically
creates a personal cabinet in sharpay
*** Shares content – the user published a link to interesting content on his/her pages in social
networks, in one or more at his/her discretion
**** Withdraws tokens – through a quarterly sharpay program of buying tokens, or through cryptoexchanges
***** Receive notification of a new content according to the targeting – sharpay sends to users,
who meet specified criteria, notifications about the possibility to share new interesting content that
sites promote for tokens

16

Economic model of multisharing stimulation
An important element of the whole system is the built-in economic model
for stimulating content distribution. After the user a) decides to «share»
interesting content, b) writes his/her comment on it, c) chooses, at his/
her discretion and interests of the audience, the social media to share
on, d) presses the button «Send» — the user will see that tokens for the
distribution of content and following links accrued on the balance of his/
her personal online wallet in Sharpay.
All this, of course, not only simplifies the distribution of website content on
social media (option — multisharing), forums and instant messengers, but,
by receiving rewards in tokens of the system, also encourages users to
repeat multisharing in the future in order to «earn».

Sharpay business model
The basis of the economic model of Sharpay is the following:
• CTR is the ratio of users who click the Sharpay content sharing
buttons with blockchain rewards
• Number of websites and applications with buttons is the total
number of websites and mobile applications with Sharpay buttons
installed
• Number of websites that buy Sharpay tokens is the percentage of
websites and mobile applications from the total number of those which
installed buttons that use Sharpay tokens to encourage content
distribution
• Average traffic on websites/per month is the average traffic size
on each website with Sharpay buttons (Sharpay’s own analytics based
on open data on monthly traffic on the Internet on different websites)
• The ratio of verified users receiving Sharpay tokens is the
percentage of users distributing content through the Sharpay buttons
that passed the internal anti-bot filter of the Sharpay system
• CPV (cost per visit) for a website is the minimum cost of 1 visit for
a website (how much the website gives to users in USD equivalent)
corresponds to the market value of 1 Sharpay token, starting from the
nominal value at the start of the system
• CPV (cost per visit) for a verified user who receives Sharpay
tokens is the minimum cost of 1 click / following for the user (how
much the user receives from websites in USD equivalent) depends on
the Sharpay fee, in relation to the cost of the click cost for the website
• Click efficiency ratio is an increase in the cost of a click, in
accordance with targeting, is an indicator of the relevance of the
audience, following the distributed links to the quality parameters of
such an audience set by websites that the better the quality of the
audience - the more the website gives to users, who have distributed
links.
• User activity ratio (the amount of paid sharing per user a day) is the
Sharpay antispam filter: how many links per day can the user

18

distribute (total) with the help of Sharpay buttons, the followings for
which will be paid to the user by the websites
• Sharpay fee is the percentage of the actual turnover of the tokens
inside Sharpay retained as a reward

Financial plan
The main source of Sharpay monetization is the commission from the
turnover of tokens in the system. The calculations in this Financial Plan
are carried out according to the plan of revenue received from commission.
Note that in future it is planned to activate additional ways of
monetization, namely, provision of premium services and advertising
placement in multisharing windows.
The economic model of Sharpay is based on the following formulas:
• Traffic (Sharpay button impressions) per year = Number of
websites and applications with Sharpay buttons × Average traffic on
websites / per month × Number of months in the year
• Number of Sharpay button impressions on websites that buy
tokens = Number of traffic (Sharpay button impressions) per year ×
Number of websites that buy Sharpay tokens
• Number of user clicks on Sharpay buttons (number of
sharings) = Number of Sharpay button impressions on websites that
buy tokens × CTR (click-through rate) × User Activity Ratio (number
of paid user sharing per day) × Number of months in the year
• Number of verified user clicks on Sharpay buttons (number of
paid sharings) = Number of user clicks on Sharpay buttons (number
of sharings) × Verified users receiving Sharpay tokens ratio
• Cost of visits for websites= The number of clicks of verified users
on the Sharpay buttons (the number of paid sharings) × CPV (cost per
visit) for a website × Ratio of click efficiency
• Sharpay fee = CPV (cost per visit) × Sharpay fee size
• TOTAL, Sharpay earnings = Sharpay fee
Tables below show the indicators of the Sharpay economic model planned
to be achieved depending on the implemented scenario of the project
development.

Strategic plans
Over the next 3 years, Sharpay plans to:
• create a partnership base of 200–500 thousand commercially viable
websites and applications that install Sharpay multisharing button
(depending on the development scenario)
• have up to 50 million users registered (based on the planned number
of websites with buttons and their average monthly traffic)
Sharpay expects that the trend for the growth of blockchain technologies
popularity will become a powerful driver for the creation of the sharing
market with blockchain rewards. Moreover, new websites and mobile
applications that previously did not use any sharing aggregators at all will
be virally involved in the process. This should have an additional impact;
actual penetration of Sharpay can be many times higher than the
claimed one.
Today, old-generation buttons for aggregated sharing are installed only on
30–50 million websites, which is about 3–5% of the total number of
websites on the Internet. All of them do not use economic stimulation of
content distribution.
According to our forecasts, the distribution of Sharpay multisharing
technology with blockchain payment will increase the penetration of
aggregated sharing buttons by no less than up to 10%. Sharpay can
drive the market growth multiple times. Based on the current market
capacity assessment, Sharpay plans to occupy at least 50% of its growth
in 5–7 years. This is equivalent to 35% of the aggregated sharing market
in general.
Not long ago, AddThis.com, one of the most well-known world
aggregators of the obsolete sharing, was taken over by Oracle with an
appraisal of about $200 million. The future Sharpay capitalization from
the point of view of the occupied share of the sharing market should
surpass the AddThis.com performance by at least 2 times. Thus, the
market valuation of Sharpay may reach about $400 million in 3 years,
and $1 billion in 5 years, as it continues to expand. Same benchmarks are
also confirmed in terms of the planned number of partner websites in the
system for the same period, their average need for Sharpay tokens to pay
for promotion and, consequently, the market value of Sharpay tokens.
29

Risks and opportunities
Please note that we adequately assess the market potential, our risks, and
the opportunities that our entry will provide for the existing established
competitors.
These risks are taken into account in our planning and financial
performance.
The launch of Sharpay can be a driver for the existing market players and
their tuning in to the spirit of the times. However, Sharpay is clearly in a
winning position against them, thanks to the time difference, as well as
the availability of a ready-to-use technology that Sharpay team was the
first to apply to this market.
Moreover, we enjoy the following advantages:
1.

Not only has Sharpay implemented a sharing button with blockchain
rewards, but also has ALREADY activated the international patent
protection procedure, which means a priority in the future in terms of
providing such services.

2.

Any potential competitor needs to restructure their development model
to enter a new market, which is long, difficult, and expensive.
“You snooze, you don’t win. Early bird gets the worm”

Sharpay operates within the «blue ocean» concept, which is conscious
avoiding price competition in traditional low-margin markets by seeking
new free niches and gaining technological leadership there. This approach
is designed to ensure the company’s entry to a new market and the
creation of a new demand. The multisharing and blockchain for sharing
are basic innovations in the Sharpay’s strategy. Currently Sharpay is
the only company in the market that implements both these factors on a
technological level at a time.

Marketing and sales
The successful market penetration of sharing buttons with blockchain
rewards depends on the efficient development of the partner network.
Having focused all efforts in marketing and sales on building this
network, Sharpay will get a full-fledged closed ecosystem. Sharpay’s
30

partner network is platforms, websites, online services, aggregators
and applications that have Sharpay buttons installed. Organic traffic
of a partner network is a natural supplier of Sharpay end beneficiaries:
platform users who promote content through multisharing.
The proper creation of a partner network will allow the token turnover
to reach $75 million only within the system in the first 3 years of
development, or up to $160 million in case of a wider penetration of the
company due to high Token Sale raises.
The following is a list of Sharpay potential partners, ranked according to
the market share and strategic interest, partly with the market valuation.
1.

Search engines, platform owners and contextual advertising operators:
Google, Yandex, Mail, Rambler, Begun and others — the largest market
players of all categories of digital marketing services. They set the
tone and run the market in general.

2.

Social media. To increase revenue through the diversification of
advertising services.

3.

Online media. Wider coverage in the distribution of news and content.

and further monetize their services.

5.

Aggregators of sharing and posting: market volume of up to 100
companies. They can buy licenses to use Sharpay. Old-generation

programs, advertising RTB exchanges. They are looking for ways of
additional monetization, growth of the client base, and traffic increase.

7.

32

Roadmap

33

Emission, tokens, Token Sale
To finance the project, the international company Sharpay Inc. plans to
issue and sell its own tokens to investors through a transparent Token
Sale mechanism (Initial Coin Offering), using a Smart contract. This will
allow future holders of Sharpay tokens to earn on the growth of the
tokens market value at the exchange market, as well as to get full access
to the system’s services by pre-purchasing tokens at an early stage of the
project development for a notional value with an additional benefit.
In the context of «tokenization» and integration of Sharpay technology
with the blockchain, the project is planned to be implemented in two
stages:
Stage 1: ETH-based emission of the necessary volume of tokens for free
sale, provision of the internal economy of the project, and distribution
among users for multisharing and content promotion.
Stage 2: development and launch of the private blockchain, as well as the
token migration. To ensure the speed and conditional «simplicity» of the
implementation, it is considered to use the possibilities of the BitShares
blockchain fork with the POS-basis for the future Sharpay blockchain.
The reason to choose BitShares blockchain system is justified by the
characteristics of this system, which surpasses the analogs for a number
of characteristics:

Tokens not sold during Presale and Token Sale will be transferred to the
reserve fund for the further system functioning, immediately after the
Token Sale.
After the Token Sale, Sharpay’s tokens will be traded at cryptocurrency
exchange. This will provide an opportunity for users of the system to
purchase it openly by gaining access to the platform products and sell it to
the ecosystem participants interested in obtaining this access.

38

Token price strategy
Sharpay tokens are classic user tokens that will be used within the
service without any time limit.
Sharpay plans an emission, which will be limited to 4 billion tokens. By
using the token within the system, their number at the exchange will
gradually decrease.
Due to the free circulation of the token outside the service, its price is
unlimited and will be determined by the market based on demand and
supply. The main factors of growth are the demand and supply at the
cryptocurrency exchange, as well as the growth rate of the project itself.
The project value will increase due to the increase in the number of users.
The Sharpay tokens value will depend on how actively the tokens are
used at the platform and its number in the system. The token price may
also depend on market conditions and other factors.
The main ways to increase the number of tokens in the market:
• allowing users to earn tokens on the platform through multisharing
• selling tokens from the reserve to companies that use the Sharpay
button to attract customers.

39

Buyback program
Sharpay plans to reserve 90% of the revenue quarterly to ensure the
buyback of Sharpay tokens from the system users, who receive tokens
as compensation for sharing/multisharing. The program starts with the
results of Q3 2018.
The buyback price is based on the nominal price of the token and is the
amount of 0,00003 ETH, that is approximately equal to $0.01 at the time
of the official launch of the project in November, 2017.

Buyback scheme
1.

Quarterly, 90% of the company’s revenue goes to the buyback of
tokens. Preparations before the start of the buyback procedure take 1
(one) month.

2.

Sharpay places a Smart contract for the purchase of tokens with a
fixed amount and a closing date in 30 (thirty) calendar days.

3.

Sharpay users are informed of the possibility to sell tokens.

4.

The tokens owners send it for sale until they reach the amount
covering re-purchase of the number of tokens defined by the Smart
contract.

5.

One can send and withdraw tokens before the closing date of the
Smart contract. After this date, the number of tokens is fixed and
all participants receive the payment, in proportion to the number of
tokens left in the contract.
