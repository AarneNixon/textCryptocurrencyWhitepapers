Introduction
Since its inception, trading and investing in cryptocurrencies remains one of the most complex ﬁnancing
forms, requiring substantial time and knowledge to have consistent positive results. This is further
doubled by the constant growth patterns in the market and the fact that the market operates 24/7, adding
to the high volatility levels. This means that trades need continuous monitoring and input, unlike traditional
stock markets, where a more lax approach can still function.
Due to the high complexity level, new solutions are required for coping, with automation being the most
widely sought after. Due to this, some platforms have introduced a few rudimentary solutions to tackle this
issue. The attempts number things like bot marketplaces, back testers, or bot builders. However, the
notion of an even remotely complete ecosystem remains elusive.
From a cost point of view, the barrier to entry remains high, creating a closed-off ecosystem and limiting
the chances of more extensive participation from interested parties. This mentality has become pervasive,
with hidden fees and uncertain regulations, which contribute to an overall lack of equitability and fuel a
race for proﬁt. This opaque environment draws in only certain types of users, namely those who can adapt
on the go to the context. Additionally, the high level of centralization gives little, if any, a choice to revenuegenerating users.
There is much data ﬂoating around at the moment to prove the viability of blockchain technology and
cryptocurrencies, ending the notorious bubble argument once and for all. Because the core principles
which sit at the core of the technology, such as decentralization, transparency, privacy, and security, ensure
the long term viability.
This aspect, taken together with most platforms’ current state, creates a potential gap in the market,
creating a perfect disruption environment. Most existing platforms are diﬃcult to use and understand,
requiring either in-depth trading knowledge or programming skills, sometimes alienating new customers
and proving to be time-consuming for the more experienced traders.

Crypto Traders challenges

Heterogeneous trading ecosystem
With the rising demand for cryptocurrencies, there is visible growth in the number of trading signal providers
that sell advice for buying/selling assets. Distinguishing between legit platforms and scammy ones is
increasingly diﬃcult. Most of these ‘signal providers’ do not offer automated trading solutions and often have
inadequate risk management, and some lack speciﬁc trading strategies. We want to raise the bar and set the
industry standard regarding creating a platform that empowers its users.

Disparate trading tools
Eﬃcient crypto-trading implies the use of multiple tools and services. This brings high costs for the end-user
both in money and in time. Every newcomer is confused between exchanges, chartism tools, event calendars,
market data, news aggregators, portfolio trackers, signal providers, trading bots, and other tools. It’s
challenging to navigate this market of uncertainty, especially as a noob.

Unpredictable results
The crypto market volatility is both an attractive and detracting factor for investors, based on their savviness
and investment experience. This factor can become a nuisance if the trading tools are not up to the task, and
amateurs are building them.

Market Overview
With the launch of Bitcoin, trading services have started offering OTC options to buy this coin, and after new
digital currencies emerged, the crypto trading sector has boomed. Even if the ﬁeld is less than a decade old, its
growth is evident.

Simultaneously, the trading environment becomes more attractive to investors and startups, leading to a
growing number of exchanges popping on the market. According to Cambridge University, the number of
identity-veriﬁed crypto-asset users was at 35 million in 2018 and grew by 189% until 2020 Q3, totaling 101
million users across 191 million accounts at service providers.
The accounts number increased YoY by 37%, which means that individuals are opening multiple accounts on
different platforms. Hence the need to see the big picture of their investments from a single dashboard.

Strategy Marketplace
On most platforms, users can copy a portfolio of assets or follow a trader. Having funds blocked and
accessing markets by proxy is not pleasant nor useful. On Bot Ocean, users can take advantage of strategies
and strategy portfolios to manage their assets without uncertainty on whether their money is safe or
accessible. All the strategies that get published on Bot Ocean are back-tested and veriﬁed by the Bot Ocean
tools and then receive a grade depending on the strategy’s quality and results.
Live Trading Bot
For users who do not want to follow independent strategies or create their own, Orka Labs has prepared a
Live Trading Bot that facilitates live trading. The process through which the user goes is:

Select desired output
(percentage of proﬁt)

Input preferred risk proﬁle
(this includes drawdown and
type of traded assets)

A Bot is ready to be
integrated with the user’s
wallet on an exchange.

Decentralized account management and payout system
We keep our crypto-oriented vision as close to us as possible. Therefore, the account access of each user will
not be managed through a centralized system. All crypto-keys (private and public) are always kept by the user
and stored on their computer. Neither Bot Ocean nor anyone else has access to these. The user is free to deal
directly with their cryptocurrency exchanges without the knowledge or interference of Bot Ocean.

Each user will be able to access their account through their favorite wallet integration, such as Metamask. The
user’s Ethereum address is the single way to access an account. We do not store any private keys or other
information about the user. In addition to having a decentralized account management system, we will be
managing all payouts made to the trading strategy creators through a smart contract system, thus ensuring
transparency through the platform end to end.
Exchange account aggregation
Users keen on manual trading will have the opportunity to connect all their accounts to view their open trades
and take action through Bot Ocean. In this way, manual traders will have their control center where they make
the most out of their portfolio.
Portfolio tracker
Hodl-ers can now track their portfolio using our app by merely inputting their addresses, and we will take care
of the rest. In the past, Blockfolio was the only choice for this, enabling the tracking of addresses. We cover
both address tracking and trading tools, so all types of crypto users can track their ﬁnances end-to-end. This
tool will provide the user with:

Portfolio evolution for a
certain period in BTC and USD

Current portfolio
distribution

Available funds
in wallets

Analytics Dashboard
Having intense trading activity and keeping funds in crypto requires an analytics overview of an individual’s
ﬁnances at least as eﬃcient and straightforward to understand as the most advanced FinTech platforms out
there. We provide ready-made dashboards for users to keep track of their trades, transactions, and balances
through our data visualization tools.
Social Trading
Copy-trading lets you copy whatever the trader is doing. It is an automated trading tool that emulates the
professional traders’ strategies and trades and replicates them as your own. Plus, unlike traditional brokers
who take a ﬁxed charge from the invested capital, pro traders on the social copy trading environment will only
take a share of your winnings, meaning that they will only make money when you make a proﬁt. Users will also
always keep full control of their cryptographic assets on third-party exchanges.

Business Model
Bot Ocean’s Business Model democratizes trading tools, starting with the tools required to build your
strategies. To lower the entry barrier to trading, we follow a freemium model.

The platform’s users are:
Anglers

Shipwrights

Bot Users

Strategy creators

Account Levels for Shipwrights
Shipwrights represent users who create new trading strategies and publish them on the platform. They are
split into multiple levels based on their AUM. Unlike other popular trading platforms, Bot Ocean does not
require strategy creators to have any personal funds in the platform.

The levels are:
Walrus:
You must not have had a monthly
loss of more than 20% in the
previous six months (unless the
market experienced such a drop).
For new strategies, backtesting
results will be considered.

Manatee
You have been at the Walrus level for
at least 30 days.
You have at least ten average daily
veriﬁed copiers with a combined AUM
of at least 5 BTC.

You are not copying other
Shipwrights.
You have at least one angler with a
minimum AUM of 0.1 BTC.

Bot Ocean

Narwhal

Thousand Tonne Beluga Whale

You have been at the Manatee level
for at least 60 days.

You have been at the Narwhal level for
at least 60 days.

Your account has average equity of
at least 2.5 BTC.

You have an AUM of at least 100 BTC.

You have an AUM of at least 25 BTC.

The stages for the Shipwrights are updated each Sunday night at 22.00 UTC and refreshed instantly. The
follower count starts when the 1st trade using the bot is placed from a new account. There are no withdrawal
fees for Shipwrights funds as their rewards are transferred to their Ethereum address monthly.

Account Levels for Anglers
Anglers represent users who create accounts on Bot Ocean to connect strategies to their exchange accounts.
They do not develop new strategies but follow already existing ones. To use the bots on their exchange
accounts, Anglers will have to connect their exchange API key to their Bot Ocean account and pay their tier
fee. Then the trading will start automatically. All platform fees are computed in ETH using the CMC price for
the base token of the order and must be paid every 30 days to the Bot Ocean wallet; otherwise, the trading
services will be suspended.
Anglers are split into multiple levels, based on their last 30 days volume using Bot Ocean Strategies.

The levels are:

BOT Token
Token Functionality
The BOT token is a utility token focused on the value brought to the platform’s users. Therefore, the main
advantage that the token brings to the users is a lifetime discount to platform fees.

The token holders paying with BOT tokens will have a 50% discount on these fees. Tokens collected
from paying fees in the Bot Ocean wallet will be burned instantly. Tokens received by the strategy
creator will be transferred to their wallets.

Roadmap
The average daily crypto trading volume is over $150B, with over 6000 markets to choose from. Strategy
creators can take advantage of the whole market offering and connect the bots to Huobi, Bitmex, and Binance.
We will integrate more exchanges gradually based on daily volumes.
Based on our calculation, on a daily volume of $1.1M, we can produce a $1M revenue per year. We expect to
achieve this in the ﬁrst 12 months of operations.
