1. ACE Project Overview

TokenStars Company

White Paper

1.1. Abstract. Fifteen Reasons to Support.
1

This is the first project to tokenize people, specifically celebrities.

2

It starts with tennis and football verticals. At later stages, it will utilize a shared infrastructure and launch the
new verticals (poker, basketball, hockey; cinema actors, models, musicians). The football GOAL token sale is
conducted simultaneously; please see the football white paper here.

1
2

We start with 2 sports
most popular globally,

3

then we add other 
sports verticals,

3

and move beyond sports
to celebrities (actors, models,
music groups).

This project will allow swapping sport-specific tokens (ACE for tennis, GOAL for football, and others later) for
the general STAR index token, so early supporters will get a priority seat in the launching verticals.

4

ACE provides funding and promotion resources to young aspiring tennis players at the critical junior age, so
they don’t drop out of professional sports. This significantly increases their chances for success. Additionally
ACE offers representation and promotion to the established (pro) tennis players, that are already attractive
for sponsors but were overlooked by traditional agencies.

5

When successful, women and men tennis stars earn prize money (less than $1 million for 400th ranked player,
$60+ million for a top-5 player) and accumulate celebrity status, sign sponsorship deals (which are roughly
5-10X times larger than the prize money earned over the player’s career).

6

ACE decentralizes the talent sourcing process to ensure a high-quality flow of candidates. Unlike traditional
agencies with limited number of in-house scouts, ACE will create a Global Scouts Network, encouraging scouts
with well-balanced stimuli to bring the most talented players to the ACE platform.

7

ACE decentralizes the talent promotion process to attract more advertising contracts to the PRO players.
ACE will create a Global Promoters Network and use the stimuli for talent promotion (up to 10% of the
contract) which will provide a good flow of sponsorship deals to the players.

5

8

ACE uses the Decentralized Community Voting (DCV) mechanism for making particular operational
decisions. A smart crowd that relies on analytical reports will make better decisions than would a biased sports
agent relying on his gut feeling.

DCV Mechanism

ACE is based on a proven business model of the talent management agency (TMA). Thus, the project risks are
in execution, not in the technical barriers or lack of product-market fit.

10 ACE has assembled a top-notch advisory board which will bring both tennis and business experience to
stimulate project growth:
•

Anastasia Myskina – No. 2 in WTA ranking and Roland Garros champion.

•

Sergey Demekhine – coach of Vera Zvonareva (No. 2 in WTA).

•

Maya Kurilova – ex-Operational Director at Octagon, 11 years of experience in tennis talent management.

•

Elena Masolova – serial entrepreneur with 3 exits, founder at Groupon Russia (0 to $15M in monthly
revenue in 450 days), Pixonic, Eduson and AddVenture Fund.

•

Ksenia Chabanenko – ex-VP Communications & Biz Dev at Mail.ru Group ($8.9 billion market cap).

•

Irina Shashkina – ex-CMO at Groupon Russia, ex-COO at Rambler&Co ($0.6bn market cap).

•

Alex Stratilatov – co-founder and managing partner at JAMI, top 5 Russian digital agency.

11 ACE has already proven its business concept. We have signed the first contract with an established PRO
player - Veronika Kudermetova, winner of 19 international tournaments (No. 66 in WTA ranking in doubles, top
200 in singles).
We are close to signing the first advertising deal for Veronika.
12 ACE aspires to introduce 1 billion tennis fans to the blockchain world. Top-20 players have 172 million active
fans. We put special emphasis on global PR and marketing among the non-geeky tennis fans. The message ‘be
part of the next Federers’ success and get exclusive offers from this star’ should resonate with them.

6

13 ACE targets a giant and fast-growing market. Top 50 sports talent management agencies have over $40
billion of contracts under management which is greater than the market capitalization of such companies1 as
Nippon Steel,  Tata Motors, Hyundai Heavy Industries, or the GDPs of countries like Serbia (EU), Bahrain, Cyprus
(EU). Sports industry is booming now – total prize money in Grand Slam Championships has dramatically
increased 4X during last 15 years. The project disrupts the huge incumbents’ business and shares the created
value among the community members.
14 ACE is a global project looking for players and sponsors worldwide (this means higher market size, higher
diversity, and less dependency on local regulations).
15 Finally, and most importantly, ACE product tokens offer token holders unmatched value (exclusive
communication with stars, one-on-one training, VIP tickets and books, business endorsements well below
market price, etc.)
Blockchain allows previously impossible ways to collectively support athletes, to decentralize key processes
(scouting and promotion) which lowers the costs dramatically and shifts most of the created value to the
community.
This paper studies the ways of tokenizing tennis players.

1.3. Introduction into Tokenizing Sports Professionals and Celebrities
Sport professionals and celebrities in general can be viewed as assets.
Over the course of their careers, athletes improve their skills, gain unique professional abilities, and start play
against higher skilled professionals which improves their skills even more. We call this the ‘self-reinforcing
professionalism cycle’.
At the same time, extraordinary results attract fans – which make the athletes of interest to the sponsors – who pay
disproportionately high money for the image of the now-popular athletes – who start leading celebrity lifestyles,
and attract even more fans. This is the ‘self-reinforcing celebrity status cycle’.

What happens over the course of a few years is that in a very sudden ‘from rags to riches’ manner, the athlete has
dramatically increased their own value (both in skills and celebrity status).
ATHLETE’S VALUE GROWTH
After athletes become professionally successful and famous, there is a lot
they can give in return to early supporters:
•

a share of earned income (in one form or another, directly or indirectly)

•

endorsements for supporters’ business entities and non-profit causes
(via commercials or social media posts) well below the market price

•

training time (one-on-one or in group, in person or in the form of online
lessons)

•

communication with fans (via video chats, text chats, offline group
exclusive meetings, selfies, etc.)

•

signed merchandize, books

•

tickets to events, etc.

Funding

TokenStars Company

White Paper

2.1. Costs Breakdown
From the age of 8 to the age of 18, before young players first start earning prize money at the tournaments, they
need to spend significant amounts of money:
to travel to tournaments (and receive ranking points)

to rent the courts

to buy equipment
to buy advanced medical insurance, etc.
Lack of funding is a typical problem which almost all current stars face as juniors.

2.2. Costs Estimation
The estimation of training costs «for a junior is about $100,000 a year. That comes from [is partially covered by
federations, income that comes from small clothing and racquet contracts»2 and agencies, like IMG, CAA, or Octagon
(see Section 4).

2.3. Case Studies of Sharapova, Safin, Bahrami
Case 1. As a kid, the Iranian tennis player Mansour Bahrami3
could not afford to buy a tennis racquet. He played with
a frying pan until the age of 10. He trained in an emptied
swimming pool at night because he couldn’t pay for lessons
on a court. Bahrami was lucky to be noticed by the person who
became his coach, and he became a professional player and a
finalist of the prestigious Roland Garros Grand Slam tournament.
Case 2. The Russian player Marat Safin was turned down by the IMG agency at age
14 and, like many, had to find a sponsor in a hard, time-consuming and humiliating
process. Israeli businessman Bruce Rappaport knew only a little about tennis, but
agreed to cover Safin’s costs. The player went on to become the 1st in ATP rankings,
won the Davis Cup twice, won 17 tournaments, including two Grand Slam titles, and was
admitted to the Tennis Hall of Fame. He has earned $14.3 million in prize money.

Case 3. At age 9 Maria Sharapova left  Sochi and came uninvited to the Nick Bollettieri
Academy in Florida. She was accepted, but her father had to work as a dishwasher in
the US to pay the bills. Maria has won five Grand Slam titles (Wimbledon at age 17), an
Olympic Games silver medal, 39 tournaments; she has reached the 1st ranking of the
WTA. She has earned $36.5 million in prize money and $285 million4 in sponsorship
deals.

2.4. Current Sources of Funding
These are the current funding options for young and up-and-coming players:
•

Parents’ money

•

Loans from friends and donors (as traditional bank loans are hard to obtain)

•

Grants from Talent Management Agencies like IMG

•

National tennis federation grants, which are usually small

3. Successful Tennis
Players Earn Millions

TokenStars Company

White Paper

3.1. Income Breakdown
Tennis stars’ income includes:
•

prize money from the tournaments

•

sponsorship contracts with equipment and apparel producers (Quiaodan, Yonex, Uniqlo, Head, Wilson,
Babolat, Adidas, Nike etc.)

•

general advertising contracts (Evian, Lotto, Mercedes, Porsche, Tag Heuer etc.)

•

appearance fees (less prestigious tournaments pay stars for mere participation)

•

licensing their image and name (to games, clothing lines, perfumes)

•

exhibition fees

3.2. Prize Money
Players’ career prize income differs depending on their ‘league’.
•

A superstar can be expected to earn north of $60 million in prize money alone over the course of their career.
Roger Federer earned $104 million5 in prize money over his career. Serena Williams earned $84.4 million6.

•

A player with 1-5 tournament victories usually earns $5-9 million. French Sebastien Grosjean (4 titles) earned
$8.1 million7, and Australian Kevin Anderson (3 titles) earned $7.8 million8.

•

A low-ranked player isn’t likely to earn more than $1 million, e.g. Chinese Yifan Xu (433 rank) has earned
$0.98M9.

3.3. Sponsorship and Advertising (Endorsements)
3.3.1. Case Studies of Kei Nishikori and Li Na

Case 1. The Japanese tennis star Kei Nishikori has sponsorship contracts with Uniqlo ($50 million), Wilson, and
Adidas, and has advertising contracts with CupNoodle, Tag Heuer, Weider Supplements, Jaccs, Nissin, EA Games,
Air Weave, WOWOW, and others.  An estimate of Kei Nishikori endorsements’ earnings was provided by Forbes.
Forbes stated that Nishikori earned $3011 million in 2016 (with additional prize money of $3.6 million this year which
suggests a rough 1X to 10X ratio for prize money compared to much larger sponsorship deals).

Case 2. Chinese tennis star Li Na (a career-high No. 2 ranking in the world, and two-time Grand Slam winner) had
multiple contracts with Nike, Babolat, Mercedes-Benz, Visa, Rolex, SpiderTech, Crown resorts, Samsung, HaagenDaas and a bunch of Chinese advertisers – Taikang Insurance, Kun Lun Water, Yili Group etc.
She earned an estimated $18 million12 in endorsements in 2014. Li Na commands a total of $60 million in personal
net worth, which includes prize money of 16.7 million13.

3.3.2. Typical Sponsorship Deals
Not all data is available publicly, but, usually, the higher-ranked the player, the more money brands are willing to
pay:
•

US star Serena Williams has a 5-year, $55 million contract with Nike

•

British Andy Murray has a 4-year, $21 million deal with Under Armour

•

Swiss star Roger Federer has a $100 million, 10-year deal with Nike

The endorsements’ estimates for the year 2016 are provided by Forbes14:

•

Roger Federer earned $54 million that year alone (with an additional $6 million in prize money, again showing
the 1X to 10X ratio)

•

Serbian star Novak Djokovic earned $28 million (with an additional $9.6 million in prize money)

3.4. Appearance Fees
Less prestigious tournaments cannot offer lots of ranking points for a victory, and so have to pay the stars simply for
their appearance. Karl Budge, the director of the Heineken Open (New Zealand), says, “Player prize money has gone
up incredibly over the last five years. Two years ago, I didn’t have to pay three of the players who were in the top 30.
Now, if I want anyone in the top 30, I’ve got to pay them15”.
•

19-year-old rising German star (currently 20th in ATP ranking) Alex Zverev declined to participate in the
Stuttgart tournament in 2017 as the offered fee was too small.

•

Roger Federer is reported to have received $1 million for his appearance at an Istanbul tournament.

•

Novak Djokovic is reported to have received $1 million from a Dubai tournament.

3.5. Exhibition Fees
Roger Federer and Andre Agassi played a match on a helipad to promote the ‘Burj al Arab’ hotel in Dubai. The exact
compensation is unknown.
Retired tennis stars often play in exhibition tournaments for $50-250K fees.

4. Traditional Sports Agencies

TokenStars Company

White Paper

4.1. Agencies Act as Headhunters, Investors and PR Providers
Presently, the funding problem of rising stars is usually solved by agencies. They sign 13- to 15-year-old tennis
players, finance them, and sometimes even run academies (IMG bought the famous Nick Bollettieri Academy). After
the player starts climbing the ATP or WTA rankings, the agencies help with advertising deals, and take a 20% cut
from the revenues (with priority rights to first cover incurred costs).
IMG signed Japanese Kei
Nishikori at age 14 (careerhigh No.4 in ATP rankings,
bronze Olympic medalist);
at 19 he won the first ATP
tournament.

Spanish player Garbine
Muguruza was signed by IMG
at 14 and won her first WTA
tournament at 19, earning $11
million in prize money so far
(she’s 23 now).

4.2. Sport Agencies Are Huge Multibillion Businesses
Top-10 talent management agencies have $25.3 billion16 in contracts under management, $1.19 billion in yearly
commissions and 3,731 years of contracts signed.
The industry is so large that it is bigger than the GDPs of Serbia (EU), Bahrain, Brunei, Latvia (EU), Cyprus (EU),
Malta (EU), Jamaica, Côte d’Ivoire, Bolivia, and some other nations.
The agency leader is the tennis talent representation and sports marketing company WME-IMG, which has a $5.5
billion market capitalization17.
In the ACE model, this huge value is shared among the community (scouts, promoters, and token
holders).

4.3. Many Athletes Are Disappointed by the Current State of Affairs
IMG is practically a monopoly in tennis. They can dictate terms (from the tournaments a player participates in to
the organization of his or her training schedule). They turn down players from smaller countries (as the domestic
market is small and there are few opportunities for advertising). And, they make mistakes in their selection process.
Roger Federer left IMG and started his own agency, Team818. He has signed several top-10 players, including
Bulgarian star Grigor Dimitrov and Argentine star Juan Martin Del Potro.
Andy Murray left Lagardere and set up a management agency “77” (name of which is inspired by the 77-year wait for
a British men’s singles champion at Wimbledon, that Andy brought to an end in 2013).
As a reason for creating his own agency Murray stated that “it will allow him more freedom in decision-making and
the chance to become more involved in his business affairs”.19
One of the most remarkable conflicts between an agency and a player was Ivan Lendl’s case, the winner of seven
Grand Slam tournaments and undisputable No.1 in the ATP ranking. Ivan was dissatisfied with the work of agency,
cause at the top of his career he experienced lack of attention from his agents. Later Lendl accused Proserv of
exploiting his image for ‘packaging’ with other players at less favorable terms.
Later Lendl left Proserv and started his own agency20.
ACE will collaborate with established pro players: ~20% of both top 300 in rankings (ATP and WTA) are overlooked
by traditional agencies, so we can offer them our Network’s advertising capacities and expertise.
Even elite players are open to changing agents and ACE will consider this possibility after initial launch.

5. Corporate Structure
and ACE Tokens

TokenStars Company

White Paper

5.1. Overview of ACE Project Corporate Structure
The ACE tokens are created by TokenStars Group Limited, BVI (“Company”), a business company incorporated
in the British Virgin Islands with the company number 1953160. Main purpose of Company is to organize and
conduct a process of ACE tokens sale in order to arrange financing of ACE Project.
The ACE platform will be developed and operated principally by Company’s affiliate, TokenStars Group L
 imited,
Cyprus, a business company incorporated in Cyprus. This company will develop the ACE platform and foster a
community around the ACE platform.

5.2. Overview of ACE Tokens
5.2.1. What are ACE Tokens
The ACE tokens are software with cryptographic elements that are sold out as a utility appliance for the ACE
platform. The ACE tokens are based on the Ethereum protocol and conform to the widely-used ERC20 standard.
The ACE tokens have their functional utility only within the ACE platform and their creation is conditioned by the
need to develop an internal economy in the ACE ecosystem that will establish transparent and fair relations among
the ACE community.
The ACE tokens are intended to be used by their holders only for its designated purposes. Number of such purposes
may be increased over time, including, but not limited to, by means of adding new services and features available
in exchange for the ACE tokens.
The ACE tokens are intended for experts in dealing with cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based software
systems.

5.2.2. Use of ACE Tokens
Means to use and interact with the ACE platform. The ACE tokens carry backbone functions of the ACE
platform. The full functionality of the ACE platform is available only for ACE token holders. We plan to place the
ACE tokens on cryptographic token exchanges, giving an opportunity to openly buy them (to residents of countries
where the purchase of tokens does not violate local laws). A user seeking to enter the ACE platform will have to
buy the ACE tokens at the such exchanges. Conversely, the ACE tokens could be sold at an exchange if their holder
would like to exit the ACE ecosystem.
However, legislation on the circulation of securities in certain countries, such as the United States of America and
Singapore, may prohibit the sale of the ACE tokens to the residents of those countries. When buying the ACE tokens,
the purchaser should be aware of the restrictions on their subsequent sale and thereby obliges to follow our
instructions and/or those of the exchange when he/she resells them to other users.
Form of expression of ACE community opinion. The ACE platform will provide ACE token holders with the
opportunity to express their opinion regarding the particular operational issues of the ACE agency’s business
through the decentralized community voting (DCV) mechanism, which is in more detail described in section 7.1 of
this White Paper.
These decisions, expressed through DCV mechanism, will serve as the advisory guidelines for the ACE agency’s
management. The agency’s management team and executives will consistently admit the results of ACE community
voting to their consideration.
Form of settlement. The ACE tokens will be used as a form of settlement in the transactions conducted within
the ACE platform. In particular, ACE tokens holders may be able to use their ACE tokens to purchase services and

22

products to be offered within the ACE platform, as it specified in Section 7.2 of this White Paper.
Means to power ACE platform’s compensation system. The ACE platform builds well-balanced motivation
system that encourages its agents, specifically Scouts, Promoters and Advertisers, to perform their functions better
thereby increasing the effectiveness of the entire ACE ecosystem and its benefits to the ACE community. To be
motivated to use the ACE platform further, its agents may receive compensation for their active participation in ACE
ecosystem, as descried in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of this White Paper. Compensation will be paid in the ACE tokens,
that allows the agents to participate in the growth of ACE ecosystem.

5.2.3. What do ACE Tokens Not Represent
ACE tokens are not securities in any jurisdiction. This White Paper does not constitute a prospectus or offer
document of any sort, is not intended to constitute an offer of securities or a solicitation for investment, does
not pertain in any way to an initial public offering or a share/equity offering, and does not pertain in any way to
an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. The ACE tokens are not intended to be marketed, offered for sale,
purchased, sold, or traded in any jurisdiction where they are prohibited by applicable laws or require further
registration with any applicable governmental authorities.
ACE tokens do not represent a loan to Company. The ACE tokens neither debt instrument or bonds of any kind
nor any other form of loan advanced to Company. Acquisition of the ACE tokens, whether through the Token Sale or
otherwise, does not grant to token holders any right of claim on Company’s financial or any other assets.
ACE tokens don’t grant participation in Company or its assets. The ACE tokens do not provide token holders
with any ownership or other interest in Company. Acquisition of the ACE tokens does not present an exchange of
cryptocurrencies for any form of shares in Company or Company’s assets, including intellectual property. Token
holders are not entitled to any guaranteed form of dividends, revenue distributions, and voting rights.
ACE tokens are non-refundable. Company is not obliged to provide token holders with a refund related to
the ACE tokens for any reason, and token holders will not receive money or other compensation in lieu of the
refund. No promises of future performance or value are or will be made in respect to the ACE tokens, including no
promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that the ACE tokens will hold any
particular value.

6.2. Disrupting the Talent Scouting Process
6.2.1. Scouting by Full-time Pros Has Disadvantages
«We have around 60 people in the IMG Tennis team, and they all have connections. I know everyone in the
Japanese Tennis Federation who knew about [Nishikori]». This Rolodex relationship building approach has certain
advantages for scouting. But:
•

it is expensive (60 full-time salaried employees amount to roughly $4 million in costs per year, excluding travel),
IMG is a monster, and smaller agencies can’t afford so many employees

•

it is difficult to scale (agents neglect traditionally non-tennis countries like India or Brazil)

•

it is subjective (based on the gut feeling of an expert, who never managed to become a pro player himself)

•

it is open to corruption (including so called ‘kick-backs’ when part of the contract amount is paid back to the
scout in exchange for his favorable review of the candidate)

25

6.2.2. Scouting Should Rely on Number-Crunching Instead of on Someone’s Gut
Feeling
Many sports organizations have changed their approach to scouting dramatically and have become numbersdriven. Managers now believe that success is predictable and it can be quantified. This analytical approach and its
influence on baseball is shown in the movie ‘Moneyball’21.
In football, scouts and managers rely on the InStat system22. This data analytics company has 1300 clients from
Barcelona to Chelsea FC who closely follow second-tier leagues and notice new rising stars early on.
A sample of InStat reports23:

Unfortunately, tennis has not gone through this transformation yet. We intend to change this (see 5.2.4.)

6.2.3. Case Studies of Rafael Nadal and Jelena Ostapenko

Case 1. When Spanish player Rafael Nadal was eight years old, he won a regional championship for players under
12, defeating boys who were three years older.
By the time he turned 12, he had won both Spanish and European titles in his age group. His uncle was a retired pro
tennis player and a coach. He was a left-handed player which often confused opponents, with a unique topspin
shot rotating up to 5000 rpm.24 He was born on clay courts (tick). You could see his discipline in training and his
energy level on court (Vamos!)

Case 2. 19-year-old Latvian player Jelena Ostapenko hits forehand on
average at 76 miles per hour - harder than many leading male players
(e.g. Andy Murray). Such forehand speed is a rare skill and a good
indicator of future success. No wonder she won the French Open in
2017.

6.2.4. ACE Scouting Model
Old-fashioned scouting process should be replaced with a decentralized
approach. We believe that the Global Scouting Network of 600 part-time
analysts spread globally and properly motivated financially will be more
efficient than the full-time 60 employees focused on making friends with local
Tennis Federations’ presidents.
With the help of ACE tutorials, the Scouts will:
•

Crunch data (local kids’ and juniors’ rankings, and local tournament results)
and determine potential ‘targets’

•

Reach out to players, parents, coaches, and tennis club owners in local
social networks

•

Submit applications via the ACE website to our full-time scouts

•

Hold assessment sessions at players’ locations (no need for expensive
2-week travel to a global HQ, like IMG does)

•

Use the most modern connected equipment during assessments, for
example, the Babolat smart racquet which gathers a variety of data during
the game (serve speed, shots hit map, rally time, etc.)

•

Use a unique internal players’ assessment checklist (50+ parameters ranging from the strictly technical side
to the players’ psychotype or their parents’ involvement). This will allow for development of a standardized
process and legitimate player comparisons

24

RPM is rotations per minute. For comparison, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi had 1800 rpm, Roger Federer has 2500 rpm.

27

•

Submit players’ assessment reports to the ACE community for their professional assessment through DCV
mechanism(see Section 6.1)

6.2.5. Scout Compensation
Scouts should receive significant amounts of money for successful recommendations in order to be motivated. It
is important to note that Scouts will receive Scout compensation only for their work performed through the ACE
platform, as it is described in the table below. No compensation shall be paid if Scouts do not perform any of the
respective actions.
In many of our target countries a typical salary for a tennis coach is around $1,000 per month (or less), so our offer
of $10,000+ is almost a yearly salary. The higher the token price grows, the larger the stimulus will be, and the more
and better candidates will be introduced to us.

The bonus can be split among several people. Players’ parents or coaches are also eligible for compensation. We
see no problems with this, as it stimulates the incoming flow of candidates. And it is only fair that the first coach will
participate in his or her players’ successes.

6.3. Disrupting the Talent Promotion Process
6.3.1. Bounty Programs
Promoters will manage the players’ fan pages in social networks, regularly updating them with high quality content
about the player to grow the fan base. Promoters may be removed if the ACE community is not satisfied with the
results.
Promoters may act as Public Relations Representatives (using press kits produced by ACE) and may pitch players to
the local press.
Hereinafter in the whitepaper: for simplicity the compensation amounts in tokens are calculated at the exchange rate of 1ACE = 1$. Actual compensation amounts
in tokens will be affirmed closer to the token sale event.

25

28

Promoters may attract advertisers (using pitch decks produced by ACE). The bonus program for any advertiser who
signed the contract is 10% of the first contract and 2% of all the following deals.

6.3.2. Promoter Compensation
Promoters shall receive significant remuneration for their duties to be motivated. It is important to note that
Promoters will receive Promoter compensation only for their work performed through the ACE platform, as it is
described in the table below. No compensation shall be paid if Promoters do not perform any of the respective
actions.

Vacancies will be posted on our website. Current token holders have priority over other job candidates.

6.3.3. Network Effects in Attracting Advertisers
In the same as traditional agencies we will have a small inside team responsible for attracting sponsors. They will
pitch brands and advertising agencies. There are positive network effects which allow the presentation of many
potential players at the same time.
Our sales team will be 100% focused on tennis players, as opposed to IMG sales reps who pitch all of the 1000+
athletes and models, with tennis comprising only around 7% of the whole business.

6.4. ACE Talent Agency Compensation
ACE agency adheres to the standard commission rate of 20% of the players’ net prize money (excluding local
taxes) and 20-25% sponsorships’ revenue (in case the sponsor is brought by a promoter the latter receives 10%
commission of the first contract and 2% of all the following deals).

29

Before ACE agency’s initial funding is paid back it has a priority right for revenue proceeds (up to 75% of the prize
money and sponsorship revenue).
If a contract expires or is terminated for whatever reason (by ACE agency, by player) then the agency still has
accumulated receivables and the player is expected to pay his debt (except the cases when the player decides to
retire from sports for medical reasons).
It is obligatory for sponsors and players to pay the ACE agency fees and commissions in tokens, so the
sponsors and players will have to buy tokens in the market. The higher the ACE agency revenue – the more tokens
are supposed to be bought in the market.

6.5. Timeline for the Player and the Agency
We expect to sign the players at 13-14 years of age, and to sign their first sponsorship deals at 14. Usually, these are
relatively small, like $10-30K for every sponsor per player per year. Exceptions do sometimes happen, of course, like
the $36K yearly stipend for Maria Sharapova at age 9.

ACE plans to sign contracts with established tennis players (top 200 in ATP and WTA rankings) who were overlooked
by agencies. These athletes earn sufficient amount of prize money to cover their tennis-related expenses, so ACE
won’t have to cover their training, travel and other costs. Established players are already attractive for advertisers
and brands and have marketing potential to accumulate sponsorship deals for $250-400K per year.
ACE has already signed the first contract with an established PRO player - Veronika Kudermetova, winner of
19 international tournaments (No. 66 in WTA ranking in doubles, top 200 in singles). We’re close to signing first
advertising contracts for Veronika (expected in September, 2017).
•

6.6. First Players’ Cohort Expected Composition
The rough estimate is to sign:
•

2 to 3 in the 13-14 age group, 1 to 3 at the ages of 15-16 (when their existing 2-year contracts expire and many
players and parents are disappointed by agencies)

•

50% boys, 50% girls (although the prize money in men’s tournaments is higher, women tennis players are more
often chosen by brands as models for commercials)

•

From 1/3 and up to 1/2 of the cohort from outside traditional tennis countries

We will specifically target traditionally non-tennis countries with large domestic market (Japan, China, India,
Brazil etc.) because even with relatively modest results such a player will be considered a star for life in his home
country, like Guga Kuerten from Brazil.
The domestic country market size is an important criterion. “If there is a young talent from Croatia, he had better be
good, because if he’s number 50 in the world we are not going to be able to do our job. But If he is from Japan, or
India or China, he can be number 50 in the world; this is a totally different story26”.

7. Use of Tokens

TokenStars Company

White Paper

Besides Promoters and Scouts compensation, ACE tokens will have a wide use in the ACE ecosystem, specifically in
implementation of decentralized governance and getting access to multiple services provided by ACE.

7.1. Decentralized Community Voting (DCV) Mechanism
The community will have a significant influence over managing the ACE agency, participating in decision-making
process in respect of particular operational decisions. Through the ACE platform, each holder of ACE tokens will
have the opportunity to voice its opinion in respect of the following issues:

Basic rules for voting via DCV:
•

Information on upcoming voting will be made available for the ACE token holders at least 48 hours in advance
(published on the website, sent via email, or communicated to them otherwise).

•

Each ACE token holder will have the opportunity to voice his/her opinion within 48 hours after the start of
respective voting procedure.

•

If the ACE token holder does not voice his/her opinion by the end of this period, then his /her opinion will not
be taken into account by ACE agency.

•

One token equals one vote.

7.2. Token Economics

All revenue paid in tokens or fiat currency will be split between the player and the agency like any other revenue in
the standard proportion according to the agreement
It is obligatory for sponsors to pay the ACE agency fees in tokens, so the sponsors will have to buy tokens in
the market. The higher the ACE agency revenue – the more tokens are supposed to be bought in the market.
The players are eligible to choose the method of payment for the most types of sponsorship and endorsement
contracts (from advertisers and sponsors). However, we will suggest them to choose ‘mixed’ payments (both in ACE
tokens and $): this will allow them to cover their spending with fiat currency and receive additional value from the
ecosystem by accepting ACE tokens (or converting their income in tokens).
ACE tokens don’t give their holders any equity rights nor do they guarantee a share in the companies’ profits or
players’ income. The profits will not be used for direct payment to token holders.

expand horizontally into other kinds of sports, to expand in depth (adding older established professional players)
and expand vertically (adding other talent management areas, like actors and models).

8.3. Criteria for Choosing the First Verticals
We have analyzed 9 parameters:
•

Total number of fans worldwide

•

Level of players’ compensation (salary and sponsorship combined), correlated with how ‘commercialized’ the
sport is (e.g. a Norwegian biathlete and five-time Olympic gold medalist Ole Einar Bjoerndalen is estimated to
have a wealth of $415,00028. This is less than a mediocre junior hockey player is paid per year).

•

Ceilings for agents’ commissions, e.g., golf and the NFL have a 3% maximum, NHL (4%), NBA (4%), MLB (5%),

•

Agent regulation (licenses required, etc.)

•

Competition between agencies (e.g. the US markets for baseball, NFL, NHL, and basketball are overcrowded)
probability of athletes’ success (e.g. in boxing or Formula-1 very few athletes manage to climb the ladder vs. in
poker thousands can participate in tournaments)

•

Total number of athletes in the upper league (only 20 drivers in Formula-1)

•

Capital requirements for the early years of training

•

Degree of the sport’s openness to outsiders (e.g. sumo seems to be closed for newcomers outside Japan)

Based on our analysis, we have chosen tennis and football (soccer) as the two most promising fields.

8.4. Technology and Business Roadmap
We start with tennis and football (see football white paper here) as they are the most obvious play. But we plan to
expand horizontally into other kinds of sports, to expand in depth (adding older established professional players)
and expand vertically (adding other talent management areas, like actors and models).

8.5. Business KPIs and Public Performance Reporting
We know from our previous successful startups that you can only manage what you can measure. We also know
that openness about the progress, problems and achievements has never hurt any startup. That is why we will
monitor and disclose monthly to the community the following key performance indicators:

10. Financial Model

TokenStars Company

White Paper

10.1. The Model
We modeled expected players’ income over the course of the career for four types of players: superstar (top-5
player), top-50 player, top-200 player and an unsuccessful player who had to stop their career early.

Then we looked at pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic cohorts’ compositions for 30 junior players and 10-20
professional players.
Pessimistic

Optimistic

Pro Cohort

Assumptions in the model:
•

30 junior players (if the token sale raises $15,000,000. For the different amount, the model adjusts
proportionally).

•

10-20 established pro players (with sponsorship promotion contracts)  

•

We have not included superstars in any of the scenarios.

•

We’ve projected the minimum $5,000 earning for players below 200th ranking. In reality, it is possible to repay
the agency costs for any player above a 500 ranking.  

•

The average sports athlete career usually begins slowing down at the age of 26, and often ends at 30 years of
age. Although this is statistically unusual, some athletes continue playing and improving even after these ages
limits. For example, both Serena Williams and Roger Federer are 36 and more successful than ever.

•

Sponsorship earnings are 2X the prize money (in reality it’s closer to 5X).

51

The model:

52

Major conclusions:
•

Every cohort (even the pessimistic type) pays off the initial costs when the players reach age between 19
and 21.

•

The projected agency revenue from cohorts is $39.7 million, $60.6 million and $78.2million. It is roughly 30%
comprised of prize money and 70% comprised of advertising money (which will be paid in tokens).

•

Income from ‘promo-only’ contracts with established players will stabilize agency revenues in the first years,
while inflows from youth cohorts will scale the business.

10.2. Intended Use of Funds
Depending on the results of the token sale we might manage to sign several PRO players (who are in an active
phase of earning income and who have already accumulated celebrity status). We might also manage to sign
a full-time coach and open a small academy for ACE juniors (thus dramatically lowering the funds needed for their
training).

For the scenario of $7.5 million in funds raised, 52% will be spent on grants, 28% of PR & marketing among nonblockchain audiences of tennis fans, and 16.6% on the team (IT, ad sales, scouting, and operations).

•

Initial player grants (38.6%) – basic spending on junior players: tennis academies, coaching, travel, equipment,

etc.
•

Follow-on player grants (12.9%) – additional funding to the most prospective junior players.

•

Marketing (19.3%) – ACE platform promotion to acquire scouts, promoters, new users and PRO players.

•

PR (8.4%) – ACE events and tournaments, PR-agency partnerships

•

Operational team (3.9%) – executive and operational management salaries, incl. taxes.

•

IT team (3.9%) – coders and tech platform developers’ salaries, incl. taxes.

•

Ad Sales team (4.6%) – salaries to sponsorship sales representatives (in-house), incl. taxes.

•

Scouting team (1.9%): Head of scouting and in-house / external coaches’ salaries and fees, incl. taxes.

•

Other costs (2.7%): accounting and audit, travel, rent.

•

Legal (1.5%): blockchain legal consulting, players’ contract drafting.

10.3. Selected Risks
•

Revenues are unevenly distributed between players. Any player unable to climb above 500th ranking would
probably not pay back ACE funding. We mitigate this risk by gathering cohorts of players.

•

Various national regulation risks exist. For example, the Chinese Tennis Federation takes a 65% cut29  from
players’ revenues. However, it is possible to renegotiate these terms, like Li Na did in 2008.

11. Attracting Audience Outside
of the Blockchain World

TokenStars Company

White Paper

11.1. Top-20 Players Have 172+ Million Active Fans Worldwide
We put special emphasis on promoting the project to the non-blockchain community. There are 1 billion tennis
fans worldwide. We believe it is high time for the blockchain community to start influencing the real world more
actively, directly, in day-to-day interactions. We also believe we should introduce the general public to the concepts
of cryptocurrencies, crowdfunding, decentralization, and collective operational decision-making via DCVs.
One of our target markets is China. Tennis has exploded there. The country now has around 15 million tennis
players; 116 million Chinese watched Li Na win the French Open. That kind of exposure is crucial to tennis, and it
never would have happened without Li30. There are 11 Chinese players who are in the top-200 in the WTA31.
Top-10 tennis players have a total of 172 million followers in social networks. Rafael Nadal has 25.9 million32 fans on
Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Li Na’s 2nd place with 23 million followers and Sania Mirza (1st ranked pair tennis
player) proves huge growing interest to tennis in China and India.

11.2. PR and Marketing to Non-Blockchain Audience Plans
In order to promote ACE and its players, our community will:
•

regularly update the players’ social media with high quality photos, videos, and posts (with the help of
Promoters)

•

pitch our stories to online and paper tennis and sports presses

•

seek media partnerships with the sports press

•

create press kits and publication plans for the players

•

do all the other traditional PR work (target press and journalist lists, pitching, press tours etc.)

•

organize professional photo shoots and video shoots for the players

•

help the players organize video chats and text chats

selectively and with small budgets promote the highest engaging posts on social networks to grow the active
subscribers (no fake users, we’re only looking for a high-quality engaged audience because advertisers are
looking for this as well).

The goal is to reach the top-20 by the number of subscribers for at least 1 of the players in a 2-year time span since
signing the player (that means 500,000+ subscribers – high, but doable).

Appendix 1. Risk Factors

TokenStars Company

White Paper

An acquisition of the ACE tokens involves a high degree of risk. Each potential purchaser of ACE tokens should
carefully consider the following information about these risks before he decides to buy the ACE tokens. If any of
the following risks actually occurs, the ACE platform and the value of the ACE tokens could be materially adversely
affected.
Risks and uncertainties described below in this White Paper may not be the only ones token holders face.
Additional risks and uncertainties may also materially adversely affect on the ACE Platform or the value of the ACE
tokens.

1.

RISKS CONNECTED TO THE VALUE OF ACE TOKENS

1.1. No Rights, Functionality or Features
The Tokens do not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied,
including, without limitation, any uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features on the ACE platform.
Company Parties do not guarantee and are not representing in any way to Buyer that the Tokens have any rights,
uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features.

1.2. Lack of Development of Market for ACE tokens
Because there has been no prior public trading market for the Tokens, the Token sale may not result in an active or
liquid market for the Tokens, and their price may be highly volatile. Even if the Tokens are tradable in a secondary
market, in practice, there may not be enough active buyers and sellers or the bid-ask spreads may be too wide. The
Token holders may not be able to exit their token holdings easily. In the worst-case scenario where no secondary
market develops, a Token holder may not be able to liquidate his/her token holdings at all. The exchanges or
platforms that facilitate secondary trading of the Tokens may not be regulated by the applicable laws.

1.3. Risks Relating to Highly Speculative Traded Price
The valuation of digital tokens in a secondary market is usually not transparent, and highly speculative. The Tokens
do not hold any ownership rights to Company’s assets and, therefore, are not backed by any tangible asset. Traded
price of the Tokens can fluctuate greatly within a short period of time. There is a high risk that a Token holder could
lose his/her entire contribution amount. In the worst-case scenario, the Tokens could be rendered worthless.

1.4. ACE Tokens May Have No Value
The ACE tokens may have no value and there is no guarantee or representation of liquidity for the ACE tokens.
Company is not and shall not be responsible for or liable for the market value of the ACE tokens, the transferability
and/or liquidity of the ACE tokens and/or the availability of any market for the ACE tokens through third parties or
otherwise.

1.5. Tokens are Non-Refundable
Company is not obliged to provide the Token holders with a refund related to the Tokens for any reason, and
the Token holders will not receive money or other compensation in lieu of the refund. No promises of future
performance or price are or will be made in respect to the Tokens, including no promise of inherent value, no

60

promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that the Tokens will hold any particular value. Therefore, the
recovery of spent resources may be impossible or may be subject to foreign laws or regulations, which may not be
the same as the private law of the Token holder.

2.

BLOCKCHAIN AND SOFTWARE RISKS

2.1. Blockchain Delay Risk
On the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block
production can occur at random times. For example, the Cryptocurrency transferred in the final seconds of
a distribution period during the Token Presale or the Token Sale may not get included for that period. Buyer
acknowledges and understands that the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain may not include the Buyer’s transaction at
the time Buyer expects and Buyer may not receive the Tokens in this regard.

2.2. Blockchain Congestion Risk
The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed
or lost. Individuals may also intentionally spam the respective network in an attempt to gain an advantage in
purchasing cryptographic tokens. Buyer acknowledges and understands that Bitcoin or Ethereum block producers
may not include Buyer’s transaction when Buyer wants or Buyer’s transaction may not be included at all.

2.3. Risk of Software Weaknesses
The concept of token smart contract which creates the mechanism of creation and distribution of the ACE Tokens
(“Token Smart Contract”), the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain)
are still in an early development stage and unproven. There is no representation and warranty that the process for
creating the ACE tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free. There is an inherent risk that the software could contain
weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of the cryptocurrency and/or the ACE
tokens.

2.4. Risk of New Technology
The Platform, the Tokens and all of the matters set forth in this White Paper are new and untested. The Platform
and the Tokens might not be capable of completion, creation, implementation or adoption. It is possible that
no blockchain utilizing the Platform will be ever launched. Buyer of Tokens should not rely on the Platform,
the Token Smart Contract or the ability to receive tokens associated with the Platform in the future. Even if the
Platform is completed, implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any Tokens may not have
functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is changing rapidly, so the Platform and the Tokens may
become outdated.

61

3.

SECURITY RISKS

3.1. Risk of Loss of Private Keys
The Tokens purchased by Buyer may be held by Buyer in Buyer’s digital wallet or vault, which requires a private key,
or a combination of private keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private keys associated with such Buyer’s
digital wallet or vault storing the Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens, access to Buyer’s Token balance and/
or any initial balances in blockchains created by third parties. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such
private keys, including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service the buyer uses, may
be able to misappropriate the Buyer’s Tokens. Company Parties are not responsible for any such losses.

3.2. Lack of ACE Token Security
The Tokens may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may
attempt to interfere with the Token Smart Contract or the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited
to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.
Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open source software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart
contracts may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the Tokens
or result in the loss of Tokens, the loss of ability to access or control the Tokens. In the event of such a software
bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of the Tokens are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or
compensation.

3.3. Risk of Ethereum Mining Attacks
The blockchain used for the Token Smart Contract is susceptible to mining attacks, including double-spend attacks,
majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present
a risk to the Token Smart Contract, expected proper execution and sequencing of the Token transactions, and
expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.

3.4. Failure to Map a Public Key to Buyer’s Account
Failure of buyer of the ACE tokens to map a public key to such buyer’s account may result in third parties being
unable to recognize buyer’s ACE token balance on the Ethereum blockchain when and if they configure the initial
balances of a new blockchain based upon the ACE platform.

3.5. Risk of Incompatible Wallet Service
The wallet or wallet service provider used for the acquisition and storage of the ACE tokens has to be technically
compatible with the ACE tokens. The failure to assure this may have the result that buyer of the ACE tokens will not
gain access to his ACE tokens.

62

4.

RISKS RELATING TO ACE PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT

4.1. Risk Related to Reliance on Third Parties
Even if completed, the Platform will rely, in whole or partly, on third parties to adopt and implement it and to
continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support it. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties
will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet anyone’s needs, all of might have a
material adverse effect on the Platform.

4.2. Dependence of ACE Platform on Senior Management Team
The ability of the ACE project team which is responsible for maintaining competitive position of the Platform is
dependent to a large degree on the services of a respective senior management team. The loss or diminution
in the services of members of respective senior management team or an inability to attract, retain and maintain
additional senior management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Platform. Competition for
personnel with relevant expertise is intense due to the small number of qualified individuals, and this situation
seriously affects the ability to retain its existing senior management and attract additional qualified senior
management personnel, which could have a significant adverse impact on the Platform.

4.3. Dependence of ACE Platform on Various Factors
The development of the Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the
public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects, or departure of key personnel.

4.4. Lack of Interest to the ACE Platform
Even if the Platform is finished and adopted and launched, the ongoing success of the Platform relies on the
interest and participation of third parties like developers. There can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be
sufficient interest or participation in the Platform.

4.5. Changes to the ACE Platform
The Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although Company Parties
intend for the Platform to have the features and specifications set forth in this White Paper, changes to such features
and specifications can be made for any number of reasons, any of which may mean that the Platform does not
meet expectations of buyer of the Tokens.

4.6. Risk associated with Other Applications
The Platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which the
Token will have no intrinsic value.

63

4.7. Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Cryptocurrency Value
The proceeds of the sale of the Tokens will be denominated in cryptocurrency, and may be converted into other
cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of cryptocurrencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Token
Presale or the Token Sale, Company Parties may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or
maintain the Platform in the manner that it intended.

5.

RISKS ARISING IN COURSE OF COMPANY PARTIES’ BUSINESS

5.1. Risk of Conflicts of Interest
Any Company Party may be engaged in transactions with related parties, including respective majority shareholder,
companies controlled by him or in which he owns an interest, and other affiliates, and may continue to do so in
the future. Conflicts of interest may arise between any Company Party’s affiliates and respective Company Party,
potentially resulting in the conclusion of transactions on terms not determined by market forces.

5.2. Risks Related to Invalidation of Company Parties Transactions
Company Parties have taken a variety of actions relating to its business that, if successfully challenged for not
complying with applicable legal requirements, could be invalidated or could result in the imposition of liabilities
on respective Company Party. Since applicable legislation may subject to many different interpretations, respective
Company Party may not be able to successfully defend any challenge brought against such transactions, and the
invalidation of any such transactions or imposition of any such liability may, individually or in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on the Platform.

5.3. Risk Arising from Emerging Markets
Company Parties or some of them may operate on emerging markets. Emerging markets are subject to greater
risks than more developed markets, including significant legal, economic and political risks. Emerging markets
are subject to greater risk than more developed markets, including in some cases significant legal, economic and
political risks. Emerging economies are subject to rapid change and that the information set out in this White Paper
may become outdated relatively quickly.

GOVERNMENTAL RISKS

6.1. Uncertain Regulatory Framework
The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in
many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies.
It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws,
regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its
applications. Such changes could negatively impact the Tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a
determination that the tokens are regulated financial instruments that require registration. Company may cease the
distribution of the tokens, the development of the Platform or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that
governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.

6.2. Failure to Obtain, Maintain or Renew Licenses and Permits
Although as of the date of starting of the Token Presale there are no statutory requirements obliging Company
of the Tokens to receive any licenses and permits necessary for carrying out of its activity, there is the risk that
such statutory requirements may be adopted in the future and may relate to any of Company Parties. In this case,
Company Parties’ business will depend on the continuing validity of such licenses and permits and its compliance
with their terms. Regulatory authorities will exercise considerable discretion in the timing of license issuance and
renewal and the monitoring of licensees’ compliance with license terms. Requirements which may be imposed
by these authorities and which may require any of Company Party to comply with numerous standards, recruit
qualified personnel, maintain necessary technical equipment and quality control systems, monitor our operations,
maintain appropriate filings and, upon request, submit appropriate information to the licensing authorities, may
be costly and time-consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of operation of the
Platform. Further, private individuals and the public at large possess rights to comment on and otherwise engage in
the licensing process, including through intervention in courts and political pressure. Accordingly, the licenses any
Company Party may need may not be issued or renewed, or if issued or renewed, may not be issued or renewed in
a timely fashion, or may involve requirements which restrict any Company Party’s ability to conduct its operations
or to do so profitably.

6.3. Risk of Government Action
The industry in which Company Parties operate is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny,
including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will
not examine the operations of Company Parties and/or pursue enforcement actions against them. All of this may
subject Company Parties to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Company Parties to restructure
their operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Company
Parties’ reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the
Tokens and/or the development of the Platform.

6.4. Risk of Burdensomeness of Applicable Laws, Regulations and Standards
Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or the findings of government inspections or increased
governmental regulation of Company Parties operations, could result in substantial additional compliance costs or
various sanctions, which could materially adversely affect Company Parties business and the Platform. Company
Parties operations and properties are subject to regulation by various government entities and agencies, in
connection with ongoing compliance with existing laws, regulations and standards. Regulatory authorities exercise
considerable discretion in matters of enforcement and interpretation of applicable laws, regulations and standards.
Respective authorities have the right to, and frequently do, conduct periodic inspections of any Company Party’s
operations and properties throughout the year. Any such future inspections may conclude that any Company Party
has violated laws, decrees or regulations, and it may be unable to refute such conclusions or remedy the violations.
Any Company Party’s failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or the findings of government inspections
may result in the imposition of fines or penalties or more severe sanctions or in requirements that respective
Company Party cease certain of its business activities, or in criminal and administrative penalties applicable to
respective officers. Any such decisions, requirements or sanctions, or any increase in governmental regulation of
our operations, could increase Company Parties costs and materially adversely affect Company Parties business
and the Platform.

6.5. Unlawful or Arbitrary Government Action
Governmental authorities may have a high degree of discretion and, at times, act selectively or arbitrarily, without
hearing or prior notice, and sometimes in a manner that is contrary a law or influenced by political or commercial
considerations. Moreover, the government also has the power in certain circumstances, by regulation or
government act, to interfere with the performance of, nullify or terminate contracts. Unlawful, selective or arbitrary
governmental actions have reportedly included the denial or withdrawal of licenses, sudden and unexpected tax
audits, criminal prosecutions and civil actions. Federal and local government entities have also used common
defects in matters surrounding the Token Sale as pretexts for court claims and other demands to invalidate or
to void any related transaction, often for political purposes. In this environment, Company Parties competitors
may receive preferential treatment from the government, potentially giving them a competitive advantage over
Company Parties.
