0 Summary
The full name of ATT is AGREEMENT OF TELECOM TECHNOSPHERE,
which is a decentralized information communication protocol based on
blockchain technology. It is committed to providing an autonomous
cross-platform communication solution for global social networks.
Different SNS (Social Network Services) can establish an information
network through this protocol, allowing users to conduct crossplatform social behavior.
For all social network platforms using the ATT protocol, the information
circulation will support end-to-end encryption, which can create a
better timely communication experience for users, and the process of
message transmission will be simpler, faster, reliable and private.
As a decentralized instant messaging protocol, ATT combines the four
major technologies of blockchain, DNS, smart contracts and instant
messaging protocols. By uniformly identifying cross-chain account
addresses, cross-platform communication becomes possible. Each user
on the chain includes one or more server / service providers and
applications. Each user on the chain can communicate with other users
and modify the service provider at any time. With the open source and
open ATT protocol, developers can focus on how to develop attractive
applications without having to maintain the server.
Ecology and users of ATT:
BiYong, a one-stop blockchain social platform serving the world, will
become one of the first SNSs to support the ATT protocol. BiYong has
tens of millions of blockchain users and hundreds of thousands of
blockchain project groups around the world. It is a social network
platform that has received much attention and recognition in the
blockchain industry. ATT will enable unprecedented cross-platform
interaction and communication for our users.

1 Background
1.1 Basic communication software and typical
products
In today's extremely developed network, both the PC-side software and
the mobile-side app have almost networking capabilities. Mobile
terminals such as WeChat, Alipay, Meituan, JD.com and various mobile
games, PC terminals such as various relational databases (MySQL,
MSSQL, Oracle), caches (Redis, Memcached), websites and Web
browsers, QQ and various Online games are based on network
communication. Even remote desktops, network neighbors, shared
folders under Windows, and Linux login using SSH are essentially
carried out through Sockets, but they have only designed their own
communication protocols. Another example is the web browser (such as
IE, 360, Sogou, etc.) that we usually use to access the Internet. It just
uses Socket to perform a "request / response" operation with the Web
server through the HTTP protocol. The browser sends the request to the
server. A request for a URL, and then the server sends back a response
in the form of HTML. The browser then parses and renders the HTML,
which is in the end some socket operations.
What exactly is Socket? To put it plainly, it is just an interface provided
by the operating system for developers to perform network operations.
Through Socket, we can interact with the TCP/IP protocol stack in the
operating system kernel to realize the transmission and reception of
network information.

1.2 The rise of social networks
In 1971, the first email was born. The reason is to facilitate the scientists
of the ARPANET project to share research results with each other.
In 1991, after many years of practice and improvement, Berners Lee
established the World Wide Web (WWW), which is characterized by
"hyperlinks".

In 1994, Justin Hall, a student at Swarthmore College, established his
own site, "Justin ’ s Links from the Underground" to connect with
external networks. Justin Hall has updated this site for 11 years, and is
therefore known as the "founding father".
Classmates.com was established in 1995 to help former kindergarten
classmates, elementary school classmates, junior high school classmates,
high school classmates, and college classmates get back in touch.
Classmates. com had 50 million members in 2008, only to fall out of the
top 10 social networking site in 2010. Here is a lively example of
Romantic:

Ray

Sears

found

his

seventh-grade

girlfriend

on

Classmates.com. He asked her through the station's information tool if
she remembered him, and she answered "how can I forget my first
love". So they entered the palace of marriage and gave birth to two
sons.
In 1996, the early search engine Ask.com went online, which allowed
people to ask questions in natural language rather than keywords (for
example: "what movie is released today" instead of "movie release on
October 23").
In 1997, AIM, a real-time communication tool, was launched; this year, a
pioneer blogger named Jorn Barger coined the term "weblog".
In 1998, the online diary community Open Diary was launched, allowing
people to post public or private diaries, even if they don’t know HTML.
More importantly, for the first time, it enables people to respond to
comments in other people's logs.
In 1999, the blogging tools Blogger and LiveJournal appeared. Later,
blogger was acquired by Google in 2003, but the product still exists FOSS patent, which is popular among global technology companies, is a
website built by blogger.
In 2000, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger co-founded Wikipedia, the
world's first open source, online, collaborative encyclopedia, which is
completely different from the way the British Encyclopedia was
compiled. Wiki users contributed 20,000 online entries in their first year.
At present, Wikipedia still insists on fundraising to raise operating funds.

At the end of 2011, they raised 20 million US dollars to maintain 2012
operations.
In 2001, Meetup.com was established to focus on offline dating. This
website should be relatively unfamiliar to everyone, but if you tell this
12-year-old website that there are still 340,000 groups holding offline
events every month, you should be surprised. The site was created by
Scott Heiferman. After the September 11 incident in 2001, he founded
Meetup.com to help people connect with each other-and not just
online. Meetup.com is an interest dating site, he encourages people to
go out of their isolated homes to make friends and chat with likeminded people. It now has 340,000 groups in monthly meetings in local
communities, eating, drinking, chatting, socializing and even studying.
In 2002, Friendster went online, the first social network with 1 million
users. Friendster set a precedent for making friends through a personal
homepage. Two years later, Facebook officially launched in the
bedroom of Harvard University. Currently under Facebook's offensive,
Friendster is basically declining globally, but it is still popular in
Indonesia and the Philippines-interestingly, Facebook is also extremely
popular in these two countries. It seems that Southeast Asian people
have a strong social desire.
In 2003, MySpace was launched for youth and youth groups, and it
once again refreshed the growth rate of social networks: one million
registrations in a month. The development of MySpace has gradually
increased, and the useless verbal abuse has gradually increased.
Managers have not regulated it, making it difficult to expand users and
eventually being sold. If the 580 million sold to News Corp in 2005
symbolizes that it is the new star of the future, the sale of $ 35 million
to advertisers in 2011 means that the meteor has fallen.
WordPress was also launched in 2003, which was created by hundreds
of netizens around the world through online collaboration, and
currently has tens of millions of users worldwide-as of December 2011,
WordPress 3.0, which was released for a year, received 65 million times.
download. There are countless stories related to WordPress, and the
infographic tells the story of helping an autistic girl get out of her illness.

https://www.attnetwork.org

This is called Carly Fleishmann, who got rid of autism by typing on a
computer; she founded Carly's Voice's WordPress personal blog helps
others get rid of autism.
In 2004, Facebook was established. According to Facebook's first
financial report after listing in July, Facebook currently has 955 million
monthly user active users (MAU) and 543 million monthly mobile
platform active users.
Flickr was founded in the same year of 2004, and it is still a very active
picture community, but the owner has become Yahoo.
In 2005, YouTube was founded, and it was quickly adopted by Google
after its establishment. The acquisition price from Google in 2006 was $
1.65 billion.
In 2006, Twitter was founded. Because its content is limited to 140
words, it quickly became a convenient communication tool and a
powerful self-media platform.
Spotify was also founded in 2006, which is now typical of social music
sharing apps, with 15 million MAU and 4 million paying users.
In 2007, the light blogging platform Tumblr was established and
currently has 77 million blogs on the platform; according to data from
July 2011, the website has 13.4 million unique monthly visitors. As an
example in the infographic, a female carpenter named Ana White
started a blog on Tumblr to share her love for the carpenter's work.
Now her blog is visited 3 million times a month, and her advertising
income is enough to support her family.
In 2008, Groupon went online, the largest group buying website in the
world, but its share price has fallen by more than 80% in the past year
and has been declining.
In 2009, Foursquare went online to form a check-in-based social
network based on location. Foursquare was founded in New York City
and has a unique "4SQ Day" in New York on April 16 every year. As of
April this year, Foursquare has 20 million registered users.

In 2010,

Google launched Google Buzz,

a microblogging and

communication tool around the most successful product, Gmail, but it
was a failed product and was completely terminated by Google on
December 15, 2011.
In 2011, Google+ ’ s successor, Google+ went live. According to data
from September this year, Google+ currently has 400 million registered
users and 100 million active users per month.
Pinterest experienced explosive growth in 2012 , in large part because it
was named the "Best Startup of the Year" by TechCrunch at the end of
2011, and it is currently the fastest website in the history of websites to
reach 10 million unique visitors.

1.3 Basic communication protocol
The implementation of any network application is inseparable from
Socket programming. Of course, we can use higher levels of abstraction
and packaging, such as TcpListener, TcpClient, UdpClient, and more
abstract WCF, WebService, Remoting and other technologies. However,
in

order

to

understand

the

underlying

principles

of

network

communication in a deeper way, it is ultimately impossible to bypass
sockets.
As long as you have a little understanding of Socket programming, you
will know operations such as Bind, Listen, Accept, Connect, Send,
Receive, etc. Indeed, all network applications are a reasonable use of
these basic operations. For TCP, because it is a connection-oriented
protocol, generally one party needs to act as the server to listen, and
the other party acts as a client to initiate an active connection to the
server. The general usage of TCP programming using sockets is as
follows.
Server-side code:
Socket tcpListenSock = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream,
ProtocolType.Tcp);
var tcpLocalEnd = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, listenPort);
tcpListenSock.Bind(tcpLocalEnd);tcpListenSock.Listen(10);
while(true)
-6-

https://www.attnetwork.org

{
var workerSock = tcpListenSock.Accept();
byte[] buf = new byte[1000];workerSock.Receive(buf);
}

Client code:
Socket serverSock = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream,
ProtocolType.Tcp);
serverSock.Connect(serverEndPoint);
byte[] buf = new byte[1000];serverSock.Send(buf);

The general flow of the above code is: the server listens to the
connection, when there is a client connection, the server receives the
connection and starts to receive the data sent by the client and
processes it; the client initiates a connection request to the server, and
after the connection is successful, Send data to the server.
Many online tutorials on Socket programming mostly introduce the
above operations as soon as they come up, leading many beginners to
think that Socket programming should be like this. Even many
beginners will think that the server can only receive data and the client
can only send data. To receive data sent by the server, the client must
first listen to the connection from the server on a certain port of the
client. They only know that TCP is a full-duplex protocol, but they just
stay on knowing this concept and have nothing to do with practical
applications.
The above code just illustrates the most basic Socket programming
method, which is "interactive synchronous blocking I / O" in term. In
this way, the server listens to the local port. When there is no
connection request, the user process will block in the Accept function
until a client requests a connection. In addition, when a client
connection comes in, the server user process will Busy with receiving
client data, if a new client connects at this time, the server cannot
respond. This method is called "interactive" because it is similar to "a
client asks a question and a server answers a sentence".
Connection-oriented TCP

-7-

https://www.attnetwork.org

As the server needs to save various states of client logins, sessions, and
activities, the communication between the client and server uses the
connection-oriented TCP protocol. In addition, unlike traditional HTTP
servers and browsers that use short connections (now the HTTP
protocol uses long connections by default), we use long connections
here, that is, once the client and server establish a TCP connection, The
connection is automatically disconnected, but the connection is used to
transmit data until the client actively disconnects.

1.4 Disadvantages of basic communication
protocols
WebSocket uses a source-based security model. When initiating a
WebSocket handshake request, the browser will add an HTTP header
named Origin to the request. The Oringin field indicates the origin of
the request to prevent unauthorized cross-site access requests. . The
client of WebSocket is not limited to the browser, so the WebSocket
specification does not mandate that the Origin header in the handshake
phase is required, and WebSocket is not restricted by the browser same
origin policy. If the server does not authenticate against the Origin
header, it may lead to a cross-site WebSocket hijacking attack. The
vulnerability was discovered and made public by Christian Schneider as
early as 2013, and Christian named it Cross Site WebSocket Hijacking
(CSWSH). Cross-site WebSocket hijacking is very harmful, but it is easy
to be ignored by developers. Related cases can refer to: IPython
Notebook (CVE-2014-3429), OpenStack Compute (CVE-2015-0259),
Zeppelin WebSocket server and other cross-site WebSocket hijacking.
Man-in-the-middle attack
WebSocket uses HTTP or HTTPS protocol for handshake request. In the
case of HTTP protocol, if there is a middleman who can sniff HTTP
traffic, then the middleman can obtain and tamper with the WebSocket
handshake request, and establish a WebSocket connection with the
server by faking client information, as shown in the figure below As
shown. To prevent such attacks, you need to establish a WebSocket
-8-

https://www.attnetwork.org

connection on an encrypted channel and use the HTTPS protocol to
initiate a handshake request.

1.5 Problems with social networks


Vulnerability in itself.



Mobile phones and computer clients have security threats.



Enterprise system security risks.



Information leakage.



Brand crisis.

1.6 The origin and development of blockchain
technology
The blockchain originated from Bitcoin.On November 1, 2008, a person
who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper entitled
“ Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System ” . The architecture
concept of electronic cash systems such as stamp technology and
blockchain technology marks the birth of Bitcoin. Two months later, the
theory entered into practice. On January 3, 2009, the first genesis block
with a serial number of 0 was born. A few days later, on January 9, 2009,
the block with the serial number 1 appeared, and connected with the
genesis block with the serial number 0 to form a chain, which marked
the birth of the blockchain.

1.7 Anonymity and decentralization
Decentralization is a very distinctive feature of the blockchain. Using the
decentralization of the blockchain, we can open up some new business
applications, such as the application of returning user data income to
the user itself today. What is it? What do you mean? Luojia Mountain
God still wants to use some examples to illustrate.
First of all, let's talk about user data. User data refers to some data that
can reflect the user's personal preferences and consumption propensity.
This is like when we want to sell a product to a person, then we need to
-9-

https://www.attnetwork.org

act on his needs and psychology. An effective analysis is that if more
user data can be obtained, the merchant can sell goods more effectively.
However, in the current Internet industry, these user data are generally
participated by third-party platforms. This platform integrates user data
Sell to merchants to gain benefits, but the users themselves do not
receive any benefits. This is like someone else holding your information
to gain benefits, and you may somehow receive some push ads.
So how to change the above situation? Generally, the traditional
Internet has a third-party platform to participate in obtaining user
information. This is a kind of centralization. We need to eliminate this
situation. At this time, we can think about this problem in conjunction
with the decentralization of the blockchain. Decentralization refers to
the fact that users do not need a third-party platform to obtain user
data. Instead, users themselves provide data actively, so that we can
enable users to obtain the benefits of their own data.
How does it work? The first is that the user actively provides data, and
then

the

intermediate

data

platform

purchases

the

data.

The

intermediate data platform can encourage users to provide data
through some benefits and benefits. Finally, the merchant purchases
data from the data platform. The data platform can conduct
transactions through smart contracts. Smart contracts The purpose is to
ensure that the transaction is carried out reliably. The final revenue is
distributed by the user and the intermediate data platform. This allows
the user's data to be returned to the user. This is similar to the usual
questionnaires that are paid for. After filling in, we will get a red
envelope or some small gifts, which is equivalent to returning the data
income to the user itself.
Therefore, we can imagine that if the decentralized characteristics of the
blockchain can be used to eliminate the involvement of third-party
platforms, users can obtain their own data benefits, which will further
promote the development of the big data market.

1.8 Industry pain points
Today, social networks are like glue, and anyone can get in touch with
anyone else in the world through many social tools. However, with the
rise of various social tools, the following issues will gradually become
vital to bother users the elements of:
Who owns user data. With more than 50 million user information on
Facebook being captured and used by the political data company
Cambridge Analytica, accurate advertising content is delivered to users,
helping the Donald Trump team run for the United States in 2016
president. After the incident came to light, it attracted widespread
attention from the international community. Facebook and its founder
and CEO Mark Zuckerberg fell into an unprecedented crisis and began
to apologize to users!
At present, global technology giants, as well as traditional companies,
are doing everything they can to get more user data. Internet giants at
home and abroad, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tencent, Baidu,
Ali, and Huawei, have huge amounts of user data, and these data will be
collected as much as possible and used for user login experience.
Take Amazon as an example. Its big data analysis system is second to
none in the field of e-commerce. All the behaviors of users on its ecommerce website and APP will be collected as much as possible and
used for the next login experience of users. When logging in again,
users will find a personalized shopping experience on their homepage,
"wish list", "recommended for you", "browsing history", "relevant
products you have browsed", "users who bought this product" I also
bought "and wait to show them one by one.
Right now, the networking and transparency of personal data has
become an irresistible megatrend. For the word privacy, the generally
accepted definition in scientific research is "some attributes of a single
user", as long as it meets this definition, it can be regarded as It's
privacy. For a single user of online shopping, "purchase preference" and
"residential address" are privacy.

- 11 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

At present, human beings have enjoyed the convenience brought by
artificial intelligence technologies such as recommendation algorithms,
speech recognition, image recognition, and driverless cars at multiple
levels. At the same time, in the process of scientific research and
product development, algorithms need to be collected Using user data,
user data privacy is more or less exposed during this process.
Voices defending privacy have stated that while some people enjoy the
convenience and efficiency brought by big data AI, they also scold the
platform for reading their online privacy. Everything is your choice after
weighing the pros and cons. If you want to protect your absolute
privacy, don't use the Internet.
The independence of each social product. As major social products
divide up global users, users are compelled to register their accounts on
each social product separately, and there is no possibility for each social
product to communicate with each other.

1.9 Use blockchain technology to implement crossproduct communication protocols
Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger technology.It has the
characteristics of decentralization and information cannot be tampered
with, and is increasingly favored by all walks of life. In the blockchain
system, all information is sent to the broadcast participating nodes of
the blockchain, but the data of some business scenarios do not need to
be recorded on the blockchain for broadcasting, these scenarios are
only suitable for point-to-point communication.
In the current blockchain system, as all parties remain anonymous and
cannot directly establish a point-to-point data connection, how can a
point-to-point data transmission connection be established in the
anonymous system of the blockchain, while maintaining the point-topoint parties Anonymity has become an urgent technical issue.
Technical realization elements:
In order to make up for the shortcomings of the existing technology, a
point-to-point communication protocol for the blockchain network is

provided. , Solves the problem that because the parties remain
anonymous, can not directly establish a point-to-point data connection.
In order to solve the above technical problems, the following technical
solution

is

provided:

a

blockchain

network

point-to-point

communication protocol, including node A, smart contract, and node B.
When one of the nodes A needs to establish a connection with another
node B, The contract will broadcast the request to each node of the
blockchain. The contract records the blockchain account address, time,
and description of the reason for establishing the connection that the
node needs to communicate with. When the node B receives the new
block, it finds that A record of a smart contract, knowing that another
node A wants to establish a private connection with this node, the node
B may choose not to establish such a connection, that is, no subsequent
operations are required, and if the node B chooses to establish a
connection with it The information agreed to communicate with the
node A is broadcasted through a smart contract. The node A uses the
public key PubKeyB of the node B to encrypt the information such as
the IP address port of the node A, and broadcasts to the entire network
through the smart contract. The node B receives the encrypted
information and decrypts the encrypted information through the
private key PrivKeyB to obtain the IP and port of node A And send a
signature by the private key PrivKeyB Hello message.
Further, the node A receives the signature message sent by the node B,
and verifies the signature by using the public key PubKeyB of the node
B.
By adopting the above technical scheme, the signature message of the
Node B can be effectively verified.
Further, if the node A passes the verification, the node A obtains the IP
address and port of the node B, and sends a Hello message signed by
the private key PrivKeyA.
By adopting the above technical scheme, the node B can be made to
verify the preparation of the node A.

- 13 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

Further, the node B receives the signature message sent by the node A,
and verifies the signature by using the public key PubKeyA of the node
A.
By adopting the above technical scheme, the signature message of the
node A can be effectively verified.
Further, if the node B passes the verification, a SUCCESS message is
returned. The connection between the node A and the node B has been
established at this time, and a point-to-point message can be directly

of

the

blockchain network, a point-to-point data transmission connection can
be established in the anonymous system of the blockchain, and the
anonymity of the point-to-point parties is still maintained. The two
parties establishing the connection can transmit private data through
the connection, The establishment of a connection requires the consent
of both parties. There is no risk of abuse. Other nodes on the network
only know that such a connection exists, but cannot obtain private
messages transmitted in the connection.

Detailed ways
The technical solutions in the embodiments will be clearly and
completely described below with reference to the accompanying
drawings in the embodiments. Obviously, the described embodiments

are only a part of the embodiments of the present invention, but not all
the embodiments.
Provide a technical solution: a point-to-point communication protocol
for a blockchain network, including node A, smart contract, and node B.
When a node A needs to establish a connection with another node B,
the request is broadcast to the block through a smart contract On each
node of the chain, the contract records the blockchain account address,
time, and description of the connection establishment reason that the
node needs to communicate with each other. When Node B receives
the new block, it finds a record of such a smart contract. Another node
A wants to establish a private connection with this node. Node B can
choose not to establish such a connection, that is, no subsequent
operations are required. If node B chooses to establish a connection
with it, the information that is agreed to communicate with node A will
be passed through a smart contract. Node A uses the public key
PubKeyB of Node B to encrypt the information such as the IP address
and port of Node A, and broadcasts it to the entire network through
smart contracts. Node B receives the encrypted information and
decrypts the encrypted information through the private key PrivKeyB.
Obtain the IP and port of node A and send a Hello message signed with
the private key PrivKeyB.
Further, the node A receives the signature message sent by the node B,
and verifies the signature through the public key PubKeyB of the node
B, which can effectively verify the signature message of the node B.
Further, if node A passes the verification, node A obtains the IP address
and port of node B, and sends a Hello message signed by the private
key PrivKeyA, so that node B can prepare to verify node A.
Further, the node B receives the signature message sent by the node A,
and verifies the signature through the public key PubKeyA of the node
A, which can effectively verify the signature message of the node A.
Further, if node B passes the verification, a SUCCESS message is
returned, which can prompt node A and node B to establish a
connection.

Further, the connection between the node A and the node B has been
established at this time, and the point-to-point message can be directly
sent through the connection, and the point-to-point occurrence
message can be effectively performed by the node A and the node B.
Through

the

protocol, a point-to-point data transmission connection can be
established in the anonymous system of the blockchain, and the
anonymity of the point-to-point parties is still maintained. The two
parties establishing the connection can transmit private data through
the connection, and the connected The establishment requires the
consent of both parties, and there is no risk of abuse. Other nodes on
the network only know that such a connection exists, but cannot obtain
the private message transmitted in the connection. Through the
blockchain network point-to-point communication protocol, all parties
can be While maintaining anonymity, it can directly establish a point-topoint data connection, can establish a point-to-point data transmission
connection in the anonymous system of the blockchain, and still
maintain the anonymity of the point-to-point parties.

In order to clarify the basic communication protocol of ATT, let's first
look at the Internet's seven-layer protocol model.

3.1.1 HTTP/HTTPS protocol
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol and
is a stateless protocol. The protocol itself does not save any information
of the user, and each request is independent.
Independent requests can reduce the pressure on the server and
support larger concurrent requests.
HTTP/1.0
Disadvantages: non-persistent connection (short connection), each
request requires 2 RTT overhead (three handshake each time).

- 22 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

The server burden is heavy, but the browser can have multiple
concurrent TCP connections at the same time, and each connection
processes a request, which can reduce the response time.
HTTP/1.1
Persistent connection (long connection). After the request is sent, a
continuous connection is obtained for a period of time. Later requests
can be continuously sent through this link, and it is not limited to the
same page, as long as it is a request to the same server.

3.1.2 RDP protocol
RDP, Remote Desktop Protocol, is a multi-channel (mutil-channel)
protocol that allows users (clients or "local computers") to connect to a
computer (server or "remote") that provides Microsoft terminal services.

have

corresponding clients. The server listens to the data sent to TCP 3389
port.
Windows has provided terminal services from NT. It is a network
protocol technology (Citrix) bought by Microsoft. The server needs to
be installed and configured, and the client needs to connect to the
program. Terminal service allows any terminal with permissions to log
in to the server with a known account, and can use the resources in the
account, including software and hardware resources. At the same time,
after the protocol is upgraded, the client can use local resources after
connecting. Including local printer, local sound playback, local disk
resources and local hardware interface. All calculations are performed
on the server side, and the client only needs to handle network
connection, receive data, interface display and device data output. At
present, the linux client programs for RDP services include winconnect,
linrdp, and rdesktop. The first two have no source code, but redsktop
has been developed by the original individual and the public code has
evolved into the current project team.

3.1.3 PcoIP protocol
PCoIP (PC over IP) provides a wide range of users on a LAN or WAN
with the best desktop experience for delivered remote applications or
the entire remote desktop environment, including applications, images,
audio, and video content. PCoIP compensates for inconveniences
caused by increased latency or reduced bandwidth, ensuring end users
remain productive under any network conditions.
The PCoIP display protocol can be used for remote applications and
remote desktops that use virtual machines, physical machines with
Teradici host cards, or shared session desktops on RDS hosts.

3.1.4 HDX / ICA protocol
HDX is inspired by the ICA protocol. HDX uses advanced "Adaptive
Active Coordination" technology, which can sense the basic capabilities
of data centers, networks, and equipment, and dynamically optimize the
performance of end-to-end delivery systems to adapt to a variety of
unique User scene. This open, adaptive design also enables HDX
technology-enabled products such as Citrix XenDesktop and Citrix
XenApp to use a variety of innovative technologies from third-party
software, servers, devices, and processor partners to improve the enduser experience.
HDX technology provides a set of features that provide a "HD"
experience for users of Windows applications and desktops, any device,
on any network. HDX is a Citrix ICA remote protocol based on ICA
technology. The ICA protocol is based on TCP / IP and RTP / UDP, and
has uniquely designed mobile network with high network network
variability and low bandwidth and high latency.
Supports three technical principles of HDX: redirection technology,
adaptive

compression,

and

data

deduplication-collaboratively

optimizing the user experience, reducing bandwidth consumption and
increasing the scalability of the hosting server.

3.1.5 SPICE protocol
SPICE, the Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environment
(Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environment) is one of
the main technical components of Red Hat Enterprise Virtual Desktop
Edition. It has an adaptive remote submission protocol and can provide
the same end users as the physical desktop. Experience. With a client
that supports the SPICE protocol (such as remote-viewer) or through a
browser, users can access their virtual desktops.
Spice consists of four parts: protocol, client side, server side, and virtual
machine side. among them,
1) Protocol: It is the criterion that the client side, server side and
virtual machine side interact when interacting with each other;
- 25 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

2) Client: Responsible for receiving and converting virtual machine
data, and sending user input data to the virtual machine, so that users
can interact with the virtual machine;
3) Server: It is a user layer component integrated in Hypervisor, so that
Hypervisor (such as QEMU) supports Spice protocol;
Virtual machine side: refers to all necessary components deployed
inside the virtual machine, such as QXL driver, Spice Agent,
etc.

The figure above shows the basic framework of Spice and how the
graphic command flow reaches the Spice terminal from inside the
virtual machine (the platform environment is QEMU + libSpice). The
graphics command starts when a graphics application inside the virtual
machine requests a drawing operation (such as a GDI command) from
the OS. Afterwards, Spice will use the QXL driver installed inside the
virtual machine to capture the drawing operations of the application,
which will be converted into Spice QXL commands and passed to the
QEMU virtual QXL device backend. Next, LibSpice will read the above
QXL command, reorganize and optimize it, encapsulate it into the Spice
protocol message format, and send it to the terminal. Finally, the
terminal parses the corresponding graphic operation message
according to the Spice protocol, and then completes the screen update

- 26 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

operation.

Spice graphics command flow
The command interaction process for the Spice Agent is located inside
the virtual machine. Spice Server and client use Agent to perform a
series of actions inside the virtual machine, such as setting the virtual
machine display configuration. Spice Agent interacts with VDIPort
devices (devices virtualized by QEMU) through VDIPort device drivers
located inside the virtual machine, and VDIPort virtual devices interact
with Spice Server through QEMU's VDI Interface, so that Spice Agent,
Spice Server, and Spice Client can be implemented. The interaction
between the participants, in which the message format complies with
the Spice protocol.

Spice Agent graphical command flow
Spice clients handle different events by establishing different channels.
The client implements each Channel as a separate thread, specifically by
defining a RedChannel base class that runs in a separate thread, and
then derives the specific functional classes needed from this base class.

- 27 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

The

client

Channel

class

includes:

RedClient,

DisplayChannel,

CursorChannel, InputsChannel, PlaybackChannel, RecordChannel, etc.
RedClient is responsible for establishing the main channel, and then the
main channel creates the following channels through channel_type:
1) DisplayChannel: responsible for processing graphics commands,
pictures, and video stream display;
2) InputsChannel: responsible for processing keyboard and mouse
input;
3) CursorChannel: responsible for the display of the pointing device
position, visibility and shape;
4) PlaybackChannel: Responsible for receiving voice data from the
server and playing it on the client;
5) RecordChannel: Responsible for capturing sound from the client's
sound device and passing it to the virtual machine.

Spice Server implementation
The Spice protocol is the core of the entire virtual desktop. With the
help of the Spice protocol, the various components of a virtual desktop
can interact smoothly.

Spice agreement

3.1.6 RFB protocol
RFB (Remote Frame Buffer) is a simple protocol for remote graphics
users. Because it works at the frame buffer level, it can be applied to all
window systems, such as X11, Windows and Mac systems.

- 29 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

Remote end users using machines (such as monitors, keyboards, and
mice) are called RFB clients, and those providing frame buffer changes
are called RFB servers.
RFB is an application layer protocol based on TCP.

RFB is a true "thin airliner" protocol. The focus of the RFB protocol
design is to reduce the hardware requirements for the client. In this way,
the client can run on many different hardware, and the task of the client
will be as simple as possible.
The RFB protocol is stateless to the client. That is: if the client is
disconnected from the server, then if it reconnects to the same server,
the state of the client is saved. Furthermore, a different client can be
used to connect to the same RFB server. The new client has been able
to obtain the same user status as the previous client. Therefore, the
user's application interface becomes very convenient.

3.1.7 X protocol
The X protocol consists of X server and X client:
The X server manages the display-related hardware settings on the host
(such as graphics card, hard disk, mouse, etc.). It is responsible for
drawing and displaying screen images, and notifying X clients of input
settings (such as keyboard and mouse).
X client (ie X application) is mainly responsible for event processing (ie
program logic).

3.2.5 ATT protocol scalability
The ATT protocol can be extended in the following ways:
New encoding
A new protocol can be added for compatibility with existing clients and
servers. Because existing servers will ignore new encodings they don't
support. Therefore, the client makes a request through the new
encoding method, and no result is returned.
Pseudo-encoding
In addition to the actual encoding method, the client can also request a
"pseudo-encoding" notification server, which supports the extension of
a certain protocol. If the server does not support this extension, it will
ignore it. It's worth noting: The client must first assume that the server
does not support this extension until it is confirmed that the server
supports it.

4 Public chain construction
4.1 Node Logic
4.1.1 Agency contributions
In a P2P network, every computer participating in the network can
receive the name of the node. In the network, all nodes are responsible
for providing network services. This is because the interconnectivity of
the network nodes allows for interoperability.
Blockchain network refers to the set of nodes that execute a given
blockchain

P2P

protocol.

The

entire

network

orchestrates

and

coordinates each user's actions in the network in a fully federated,
decentralized, and distributed manner. This means that computer
networks around the world can constantly transmit new transactions to
each other. Every computer in this network is a node and it has
downloaded the complete blockchain. In this way, the network becomes
redundant, and working together makes it scalable in scalability.
Due to the decentralization of the blockchain, anyone can participate in
it. Just download the node software from and execute it. Generally, this
feature is supported in the main wallet of each item. Initially, the
network started from the origin of the blockchain until it was
synchronized with the network. At this point, the nodes started to run in
full, not only allowing verification transactions, but also supporting the
overall image of the blockchain. Usually nodes can perform the
following functions: routing, blockchain database, mining and wallet
services.
These nodes are a single part of the largest data structure of a
blockchain. When node owners voluntarily contribute their own
computing resources to store and verify transactions, they have the
opportunity to charge transaction fees and receive rewards in potential
cryptocurrencies.
Processing these transactions can require a lot of computing and
processing power, which means that the average computer power is
- 33 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

not enough. Generally speaking, professional miners tend to invest in
very powerful computing equipment called CPU (Central Processing
Unit) or GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to meet the demand for the
processing power required to verify transactions, and to obtain s return.
A node can be a communication endpoint or a redistribution point of
communication, linked to other nodes. Every node in the network is
considered equal, however, some nodes play different roles in the way
they support the network. For example, not all nodes will store a
complete copy of the blockchain.
A complete node downloads a complete copy of the blockchain and
checks for new transactions that occur based on the consensus protocol
used by that particular cryptocurrency or utility token. All nodes use the
same consensus protocol to maintain mutual compatibility. The nodes
in

the

network

are

responsible

for

confirming

and

validating

transactions and putting them into blocks. Regarding whether a
transaction is valid and should be added to a block with other
transactions, no matter how other nodes act, nodes can always draw
their own conclusions.

4.1.2 Node selection
In a blockchain network, there are traditionally three types of nodes
that provide different functions in the network. These node types are:
Broadcast nodes: They only issue transactions and receive blockchain
information from third parties. They follow the most powerful mining
power, known as light wallets, which are widely used on mobile devices
or are only used by people who don't want to download the entire
blockchain.
Complete nodes: Install complete node software, such as Bitcoin Core,
in addition to having the most secure wallet, and download a copy of
the blockchain to become a node in the Bitcoin network. As a result,
you will issue transactions, propagate the rest of the network, and verify
that consistent rules are met.
Mining nodes: In addition to operating their favorite software miners
(BTCMiner, CGMiner), the miners must have a copy of the blockchain. In
- 34 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

addition to mining Bitcoin to help create new blocks, these nodes will
also publish and disseminate transactions.

4.1.3 Node responsibility
When a miner or user tries to add a new transaction block to the
blockchain through some mechanism of the protocol, it transmits the
block to all nodes of the network. Depending on the legitimacy of the
block (signature and validity of the transaction), the node can accept or
reject the block. When a node accepts a new transaction block, it saves
it and stores it on other blocks it has already stored. In summary, the
role of nodes is:
They can check if a transaction block is valid and accept or reject it.
Store and store transaction blocks (store blockchain transaction history).
Transfer and extend this transaction history to other nodes that may
need to be synchronized with the blockchain (they must be updated in
the transaction history).

4.1.4 Node Disaster Recovery
Nodes can be online or offline. Online nodes receive, save, and transmit
all the last blocks of a transaction from other nodes, while nodes that
are not connected do not. When an offline node comes back online, it
must first catch up with the rest of the blockchain by downloading all
blocks added to the blockchain since the node was disconnected. This
process is often called blockchain synchronization.
In theory, a complete blockchain can be executed on a single node, but
because it is stored in a single device, it is very vulnerable to power
outages, hacking or system failure. The more complete nodes running
in the blockchain, the more resilient they will be in the face of such a
disaster. When blockchain data is distributed across so many devices, it
is very difficult for a corrupted entity to delete all of this data at once.
Due to the global crisis, a large number of nodes have suddenly
dropped and become inaccessible. In theory, a single node can keep
the entire blockchain running. Even if all nodes are disconnected, it only

- 35 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

takes a single node with a complete blockchain history to get back
online and make all data accessible again.
These nodes are also vulnerable to computer attacks, which may
change their function. For example, a pirate can violate the software's
security, and without changing the blockchain data, it can redirect the
node's profits to a different address written by its owner. Address theft
attacks are the most common type of attack for this type of software,
which is why developers recommend using an updated version of their
blockchain software.
These security flaws are easy to resolve, and you can use some
computer security common sense, or use software tools to create
security mechanisms to isolate the blockchain software from the rest of
the computer system. These measures include:
Use official or developer software and have a long and proven track
record. Protect the private keys, mnemonic keys and any other
privileged information of our activities in the blockchain. Use computers
or electronic equipment only for our mining activities. Use sandbox
software to isolate software applications from the rest of the system.
Use MAC (mandatory access control) system privileges that allow us to
run our blockchain software with minimal access to the operating
system and other system APIs (this isolation is larger than the sandbox).

4.2 Consensus Foundation
4.2.1 Consensus by contribution
The Contribution Authorization Proof Mechanism (PoC) is a modified
version of the Delegated Proof of Stake. It is a scalable and governance
alternative used by many smart contract platforms such as EOS and
Tron. It was built with enterprise adoption in mind and aims to reward
participation in the network By. Compared with other PoS and PoW
mechanisms, PoC aims to provide:
1) clear governance structure;
2) better throughput;
3) higher efficiency.
- 36 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

4.2.2 Consensus reward
Rewards will be generated after each block is accepted and then sent to
the library. For each new block reward, all ATters who participate in the
network as authorized or authorized recipients will receive a certain
number of ATTG to reflect their respective contributions. This ATTG can
be exchanged for ATT at any time.
The ATT model is unique in that ATTers can not only receive bet
rewards because they are P-Rep or authorized to P-Rep, but also
receive bet rewards for voting on DApps and EEPs and / or running
DApps or EEPs. In short, this provides an opportunity for all ATters to
contribute; no matter how technically inclined you are. In other DPoS
systems, bet rewards are usually only obtained by group producers. PoC
is an organization that implements a model that is beneficial not only to
elected P-Reps, but also to those P-Reps that contribute to the network
in other ways.

4.2.3 Consensus Algorithm
For reference, there is no economic motivation to vote for EOS BP. The
only benefit is governance. So far, about 25% of EOS community
members have voted, and 47% of EOS outstanding users have
participated in the voting. For Tron, based on the total supply, the
number of votes for Super Delegates is even less, only about 7%.
However, the 27 super-representative nodes that voted the most will
create new blocks and share rewards with their voters. It is estimated
Dapp and EEP will be rewarded accordingly. This is an essential
difference from any other platform. Rather than the foundation
providing funding for whatever they see fit (such as how Ethereum
currently works), the community itself can decide who receives the
grant (rewarded in the form of a block) or who delegates the ATT
project or improvement suggestions they feel is best The internet.

4.2.4 Complete Consensus Logic

- 37 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

In PoC, incentives work as P-Rep, DApp, or EEP. A key difference
between ATT's solution and other platforms is that it provides economic
incentives and economic expansion proposals (EEPs) for dapps.
The dapp will receive rewards based on: 1) the authorization of ATters;
2) the ability to implement DAU and/or Tx level thresholds (to be
determined). Currently, ATT is building its virtual step function to limit
friction from the user's perspective. Once implemented, the DApp will
be able to bet on the ATT, thereby generating a virtual step that will be
used to pay the ATT transaction fees associated with the use of the
DApp.
As discussed in the previous article, these rewards may be meaningful
compared to traditional business models. Recall that even a modest 5%
network license can reach $ 20,000 per month (under previously stated
conditions).
The other in the PoC framework is the concept of EEP. ATTers can
propose EEPs, accept commissions from their peers, and receive
funding for their respective programs through group rewards. The use
and scope of EEP is wide. At one end of this range, imagine a group of
developers who want to improve the core code of ATT to run as an EEP,
provide monthly updates on their progress, and take turns to get
funding.

Note

that

this

is

similar

to

Zcash.

In

Zcash,

core

developers/foundations will receive 20% of all block rewards for further
development. On the other hand, EEP can be as simple as a community
manager looking for funding to host a local party on a specific date.

4.3 Mining rewards
4.3.1 Definition of mining in this system
Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer network system. So there is no
"central" server and no central issuing authority. Bitcoin is produced
through "mining". Mining is to verify a Bitcoin transaction and
participate in competition to solve a mathematical problem. Any
participant (such as a person running a complete protocol stack) can be
a miner and use their computing power to verify and record
transactions. On average, every 10 minutes someone can verify the
transactions that happened in the past 10 minutes, and he will get new
coins in return for his work. In essence, mining distributes the currency
issuance and settlement functions of the central bank, and replaces the
needs of central issuers with global computing power competition.
Mining is a figurative metaphor, because in the Bitcoin network,
competitive computing gets newly issued Bitcoin rewards, much like the
process of mining minerals buried in the ground. Mining is the process
of new issuance of bitcoin by the bitcoin system. It is also the process of
miners competing for bookkeeping rights and obtaining newly issued
bitcoin rewards. A miner is a person or organization that competes for
mining.
The actual mining is proof of proof of work (POW) in the Bitcoin system.
The Bitcoin system is a large ledger, and a page of ledger is issued
every 10 minutes (this page of ledger is also called a block). The miner
records the transaction in a page of ledger and synchronizes to other
people. If this miner can calculate this first, The correct answer in a
round shows that he has paid a certain amount of work and is a person
who has the right to keep books. This problem can be understood as a
probability problem, which is very difficult to calculate, but it is very
simple to verify.
Mining is a continuous problem-solving process. It is a relay race, once
every 10 minutes. After the results of this time, everyone starts a new

4.3.2 The value of mining to the entire network
The so-called mining, for Bitcoin, is actually mining = creating value =
fair distribution of value, which is logically connected. Equivalent to a
chemical, with this characteristic, it can naturally react with human
nature.
In essence, mining is the most important step in the token economy,
but most of the imitations of Bitcoin mining have failed. If a currency
does not improve for six months and a year, it must be a mistake in the
design of the token economic model. You can only leave a bunch of
numbers in your hands.
EOS, in fact, is well designed when it comes to mining (general
certification economic model) design alone. More in line with this idea.
Its value goal is an ultra-high-performance DAPP operating platform.
Then let the super nodes go to mine and the super nodes provide super
performance. The value created is in line with the needs of the eos
application and the corresponding value distribution. Of course,
whether the 1% issuance as a miner's fee is within a reasonable range is
another issue. It is not the same application as Bitcoin, so don't make a
sharp comparison. Being a base currency is a trillion-dollar business
that requires extremely high security barriers and different value
propositions. Most Internet apps, in fact, actually Not so much business
volume, just the pursuit of performance, does not require a very high
safety factor.

4.3.3 Resources Consumed by Mining
Computing power (also known as hash rate) is a measure of the
processing power of the Bitcoin network. The speed at which the
computer (CPU) calculates the output of the hash function.
Computing power is the ability to mine. The probability that you will be
able to mine Bitcoin depends on the proportion of your computing
power in the world. The speed of problem solving is related to strong
computing power.

- 40 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

How many hash collisions a miner can do per second is a representative
of its computing power, and the unit is written as hash/s.
Bitcoin's entire network computing power has fully entered the P
computing power era (1P = 1024T, 1T = 1024G, 1G = 1024M, 1M =
1024k)
1 kH/s = 1,000 hashes per second.
1 MH/s = 1,000,000 hashes per second.
1 GH/s = 1,000,000,000 hashes per second.
1 TH/s = 1,000,000,000,000 hashes per second.
1 PH/s = 1,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second.
1 EH/s = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second.
As of August 9, 2018, Bitcoin's entire network computing power was
46.08 EH / s. Then calculate it, 46.08 * 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 =
46,080,000,000,000,000,000,000 operations per second. Computing
power is growing very fast.

4.3.4 Rewards for miners
Passive dividend
For passive dividends, profits are collected during each transaction
within an interchangeable token. Therefore, if the manager of a
homogeneous token decides to set a passive bonus for it, in each
transaction, not only will the EVT be charged as fuel, but also the
additional cost of the homogeneous token.
We correct these deviations by recording two fields on the chain,
with_amount indicates that the fee will be included in the amount, so
the payee will receive (amount-fee). outside_amount Instead, the payee
will receive the amount, but the payer will spend (amount + fee).
Active dividend
Active dividends are much simpler than passive dividends. Dividends
can be realized only by meeting certain conditions. This model is very
important for the demanding project party, and it is also a very mature
model in real scenarios.
- 41 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

We formulate active dividends through the rules declared on the official
website at the beginning of the project, so that miners can get the
corresponding reward tokens.

4.4 Penalty mechanism
4.4.1 Definition of evil in this system
If and only if, in this system, many miners have decided to join a new
mine group and mine on its new block. The problem is that the
blockchain network is a huge and widely distributed network, and
communication and collaboration within it is almost impossible. Most
miners will only choose the path that maximizes their returns, which is
why the Nash equilibrium of the main chain has been achieved.

4.4.2 Risk control
To build a falsifiable credit network model, what is needed first is a
large set of data of various dimensions such as behavior data,
consumption data, property data, and then processed to obtain a
simplified credit evaluation. The problem is not that there is no such
data, but that these data are held by different institutions and
companies, and the data of these institutions are not interoperable.
Because the ability of small companies to realize data is obviously much
lower than that of large companies. As a means of production, data
cannot be effectively protected. In addition, it involves data sharing
such as personal privacy, and cannot directly transmit plain text. The
major Internet companies have a lot of user data and make money from
it, and users don't get these additional benefits. Based on the design of
the blockchain, the data processing is made into a Mapreduce method.
The calculations concentrated in one center are divided into multiple
small parallel calculations. The results of the parallel calculations are
collectively returned to obtain a summary result. For example,
consumption data is in Alibaba, travel data is in Ctrip, financial data is in
ICBC, and education data is in the Ministry of Education. The data in
these four dimensions are stored as 4 nodes. The Ministry of Public
Security calculates the citizen's credit data and initiates a data use
- 42 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

request. However, the data is not passed directly to these institutions,
but the result of the calculation is passed. Each request is paid for 1
token. In this way, the owner of the data can benefit by contributing to
the data. A new connection was established between multiple
encouraged domains that were not interoperable through algorithms
and an economic cooperation system between computers.

4.4.3 Malicious information
P + Epsilon attack
However, a proof-of-work system is vulnerable to a special type of
attack called a "P + Epsilon attack." To understand the principle of this
attack, we must define the following terms in advance.
Non-collaborative selection model: In a non-coordinated selection
model, all participants have no incentive to cooperate with others.
Participants may form groups, but at any time, this group will not be
large enough to occupy a majority.
Collaborative selection model: In this model, all participants collaborate
for a common incentive. Now, suppose the blockchain is a noncoordinated choice model, but what if there is an incentive for miners
to take action to damage the integrity of the blockchain? What if a
particular action could be taken by a miner to take a bribe? The bribery
attacker model is now referenced.
Now, suppose the blockchain is a non-coordinated choice model, but
what if there is an incentive for miners to take action to damage the
integrity of the blockchain? What if a particular action could be taken
by a miner to take a bribe? The bribery attacker model is now
referenced.

4.4.4 Compliance Extension (PoR)
Now, suppose an attacker enters the system and bribes miners to
cooperate with each other. What should we do? This new model is the
bribery attacker model. To successfully bribe the system, an attacker
must have two resources:

- 43 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

Budget: The total amount of cash the attacker is willing to pay miners
to perform a particular operation
Cost: The amount actually paid to the miners at the end.
However, if an attacker decides to launch an attack on the blockchain,
we will get an interesting puzzle .... At this point, a "P + Epsilon attack"
will occur. We can refer to the following figure:

Imagine a simple game, such as elections. If people vote for someone
and vote for the same person as everyone else, then there is a gain,
otherwise there is no gain. So imagine that a bribe accesses the system
and makes this rule for an individual. If no one else voted when you
voted, you would get a "P + ε " gain. In addition to the normal gain P,
there is an additional bribe gain ε.
So now, the return matrix looks like this:

Now imagine this scenario. Everyone in the game knows that if they
vote, they will probably get a profit, but if they don't vote, there is only
a 50% probability that they will get a profit.
What do you think participants will do? Of course, they will vote to
ensure returns. This is where the fun lies. As shown in the matrix, the
bribe pays only the fee "ε" when someone voted while others did not.
However, in this case, because everyone voted, the Nash equilibrium
point turns into:

- 44 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

Yes, no bribe pays bribes!
So let's look at this from a briber's perspective:
Convince the group to vote in some way.
Achieve your goals without paying bribes.
This is a huge win-win situation for bribers, and at the same time, it has
a significant impact on the blockchain, especially in systems based on
proof of work. Let's check out the previous virtual blockchain again:

Assume that the bribers really want to make the blockchain hard fork,
and at the same time announce the bribe fee ε for those miners who
choose to join the new chain, which will stimulate the entire miner
community to collaborate and join the new chain. Obviously, this
requires a very high bribe fee to achieve the above situation, but as we
saw in the bribery attack model above, the attacker does not even need
to give this amount. According to Vitalik Buterin, this is one of the
biggest problems with proof-of-work systems, which is vulnerability to
"P + Epsilon attacks".

4.4.5 Evil punishment
Before each transaction, the two parties request the credit history of the
other party. Use a credit history provided by a third party to pay 1 token.
After the transaction is completed, the credit of the counterparty is
updated, data is contributed, and 2 tokens are rewarded. Data is
- 45 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

constantly being produced. You generated a bad default record on the
online loan platform last minute. This risk signal will be broadcast to the
entire network. Didi requested the driver's credit history before
dispatching the order. When the risk signal was found, Didi would not
order it.
A credit model based on such a blockchain technology system allows
good people to benefit everywhere and bad people to be limited
everywhere. We are also about to achieve the first credit symmetry in
human history to build a society in which the cost of social operation is
no longer determined by bad people.

5 Cross-Product Transport Protocol
(TPTP)
5.1 Previous achievements
5.1.1 Text Transfer Protocol
The TFTP protocol is based on the transfer protocol between the server
and the client. At the beginning, the client sends a connection request
to the server, and after the server answers, the two connections are
established. The client then sends a file transfer request to the server.
The server divides the file required by the client into multiple small
blocks and passes them to the client in turn. The client sends a
response to the server after receiving each small block. Send the next
small block. When all file blocks have been transferred, the two
connections are disconnected.
The TFTP server program usually listens for client requests on port 69. It
is worth noting that when the server and the client are transmitting
data blocks, the server will use a random port instead of port 69, which
is used to listen for requests. This is so that the server can respond to
multiple client connections at the same time. The server and different
clients use different ports for data communication, so that the data
blocks required by different clients will not be confused.
- 46 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

When the server and the client send file data, data is transmitted in a
manner called a "locking step". That is, the server sends a data block to
the client, and then does nothing until it receives the response data
packet sent back by the client. It does not send the next data block until
it receives a response from the client that the data block has been
received. This method makes data transmission inefficient, but ensures
that the data transmission process is simple enough. At the same time,
it ensures that data transmission is convenient when transmission errors
occur. At the same time, the client does not need to consider how to
block data blocks when they arrive out of order. Proper assembly.

5.1.2 Picture transfer
The English name of picture transfer protocol is picture transfer
protocol, abbreviated as ptp. PTP is a standard developed by Kodak in
consultation with Microsoft. This section describes a terminal picture
transfer protocol file synchronization method and terminal. The method
includes: receiving a PTP start instruction; and determining at least one
first directory from the terminal according to a multimedia file type,
where the first directory contains multimedia Directory of files;
synchronizing multimedia files corresponding to the at least one first
directory. According to the PTP startup instruction, dynamically obtain
all eligible directories containing multimedia files in the terminal, and
synchronize the multimedia files in these eligible directories to the PC
side. Thus, the terminal can automatically synchronize all eligible
multimedia files.

5.1.3 File transfer
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a set of standard protocols used for file
transfer on the network. It works on the seventh layer of the OSI model
and the fourth layer of the TCP model, the application layer. It is not
UDP. Before the client establishes a connection with the server, it must
go through a "three-way handshake" process to ensure that the
connection between the client and the server is reliable, and it is
connection-oriented,

providing

a

reliable

guarantee

for

data

transmission.
- 47 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

FTP allows users to communicate with another host through file
operations (such as adding, deleting, modifying, checking, and
transmitting files). However, users do not actually log in to the
computer they want to access and become full users. FTP programs can
be used to access remote resources, enabling users to transfer files back
and forth, directory management, and access e-mail, even if the two
computers may be equipped with different Operating system and file
storage.

5.1.4 Voice Message
Network Voice Protocol (English: NetworkVoiceProtocol, abbreviation:
NVP) is a pioneer in computer network protocols that sends human
speech through packetized communication networks. Therefore, the
VoIP protocol can be regarded as the ancestor of today's VoIP
technology.
The network voice protocol was first implemented in 1973 by Danny
Cohen, a network researcher at the University of Southern California's
Institute of Informatics, whose research funding came from the US
Advanced

Research

Projects

Agency's

(ARPA)

Network

Secure

Communications program. The goal of the project is to develop and
demonstrate the feasibility of secure, high-quality, low-bandwidth, realtime, full-duplex digital voice communications through packet-switched
computer communication networks, and to protect their content by
means of existing encryption equipment. The main goal of this research
is to demonstrate the digital encrypted high-quality, low-bandwidth,
and encrypted voice processing capabilities to meet the global
encrypted voice communications part of general military needs.
The previous use of the network voice protocol was to use a variety of
different speech coding techniques on the ARPANET to send voice
messages to each other from different nodes. These codes include
linear predictive coding and continuous variable slope incremental
modulation (Continuously variable slope delta modulation). Its coresearchers include Steve Casner, Randy Cole, Paul Raveling, Paul
Raveling (Institute of Informatics), Jim Forgie (Lincoln Labs), Mike

McCammon (Culler-Harrison), John Markel (Speech Communications
Research Laboratory), and John Makhoul (Bolt, Beranek and Newman
BBN).

5.1.5 Audio and Video Calls
RTSP reference in the development of many of the HTTP / 1.1 protocol,
even many description and HTTP / 1.1 are identical. RTSP reason
deliberately using similar syntax and operations with HTTP / 1.1, largely
for compatibility with existing Web infrastructure, and as such, the
extension mechanism of HTTP / 1.1, most can be introduced directly
into the RTSP. The collection of media streams controlled by RTSP can
be defined with a Presentation Description. The so-called presentation
refers to the collection of one or more media streams provided by the
streaming server to the client, and the presentation description contains
the media information flow, such as data encoding / decoding
algorithms, network addresses, and other media content stream.
Although RTSP server also use the identifier to distinguish each flow
connection session (the Session), but RTSP connection and is not bound
to the transport layer connection (e.g., TCP, etc.), that is to say during
the whole RTSP connection, the user can open or RTSP Close multiple
reliable transport connections to the RTSP server to make RTSP
requests. In addition, RTSP connections can also be based on
connectionless transmission protocols (such as UDP, etc.). RTSP
protocol supports the following operations: retrieve media: allows users
to submit a presentation description to the media server via HTTP or
other methods. If the presentation is multicast, the presentation
description contains the multicast address and port number used for
the media stream; if the presentation is unicast, only the destination
address should be provided in the presentation description for security.
Invite to join: The media server can be invited to participate in an
ongoing meeting, or play back the media in the presentation, or record
the entire media or its subset in the presentation, which is very suitable
for distributed teaching. Add media: Notify users of newly available
media streams, which is especially useful for live lectures. Similar to

- 49 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

HTTP / 1.1, RTSP requests can also be handled by a proxy, channel or
cache.

5.2 Improved transport protocol
5.2.1 Short connection message
The client initiates a connection request to the server, the server
receives the request, and then the two parties establish a connection.
The client sends a message to the server, the server responds to the
client, and then reads and writes are completed. At this time, either of
the two parties can initiate the close operation, but generally the client
initiates the close operation first. Why, the general server will not close
the connection immediately after replying to the client, of course, there
are no special circumstances. From the description above, short
connections generally only pass a read and write operation between the
client / server.
The advantage of a short connection is that it is relatively simple to
manage, and the existing connections are all useful connections and do
not require additional control measures.

5.2.2 Long Connection Message
The client initiates a connection to the server, the server accepts the
client connection, and the two parties establish a connection. After the
client and server finish reading and writing once, the connection
between them is not actively closed, and subsequent reading and
writing operations will continue to use this connection.
First, let's talk about the TCP keep-alive function mentioned in the
detailed explanation of TCP / IP. The keep-alive function is mainly
provided for server applications. The server application wants to know
whether the client host crashes, so that it can use resources on behalf of
the client. If the client has disappeared, leaving a semi-open connection
on the server, and the server is waiting for data from the client, the
server should wait for the client's data. The keep-alive function is trying
to detect this semi-open connection on the server. connection.
- 50 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

If a given connection does not perform any action within two hours, the
server sends a probe segment to the client. The client host must be in
one of the following four states:
The client host is still running and reachable from the server. The
client's TCP response is normal, and the server also knows that the
other party is normal. The server resets the keepalive timer after two
hours.
The client host has crashed and is shutting down or restarting. In either
case, the client's TCP is not responding. The server will not receive a
response to the probe and will time out after 75 seconds. The server
sends a total of 10 such probes at 75-second intervals. If the server
does not receive a response, it considers the client host to be closed
and terminates the connection.
The client host crashed and has restarted. The server will receive a
response to its keep-alive probe. This response is a reset, causing the
server to terminate the connection.
The client is running normally, but the server is unreachable. This
situation is similar to 2. TCP can find that it has not received the
response from the probe.

5.2.3 Audio and video messages
The full name of RTP is Real-time Transport Protocol (Real-time
Transport Protocol). RTP protocol is often used in streaming media
systems (with RTCP protocol or RTSP protocol). Because RTP itself has a
time stamp, it is used as a formate in ffmpeg.
Each RTP datagram is composed of a header and a payload. The
meaning of the first 12 bytes of the header is fixed, and the payload can
be audio or video data.

5.3 Cross-platform Transport Protocol (TPTP)
5.3.1 What is TPTP
TPTP (Trans-Platform Transfer Protocal), a cross-platform transfer
protocol, was initiated by the ATT Foundation for the first time. It does

5.3.5 TPTP scalability
New security approach
Adding a new type of security method will bring unlimited flexibility. It
modifies some behaviors of the protocol without sacrificing existing
client-server compatibility. The client and server can communicate with
each other through a secure protocol. Of course, it is not necessarily
similar to the original protocol.
Protocol message
Protocols can be reliably transmitted, such as byte streams or messagebased. Like most protocols, it is connected via the TCP / IP protocol
suite. The protocol is connected in three steps. The first is a handshake
- 55 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

message, the purpose of which is to negotiate the protocol version and
encryption method. The second step is the initialization message, which
is mainly used for client and server initialization messages. The last is
the normal protocol interaction. The client can send messages on
demand, and then get a response from the server.
All messages start with a message type, followed by specific message
data.
The basic types of protocol message descriptions are: U8, U16, U32, S8,
S16, S32.
U represents an unsigned integer, and S represents a signed integer.
All byte integers (except the pixel value itself) follow the big endian
order.
Big endian or little endian is related to cpu, which affects the order of
integers in memory.
Endian is high byte first, little endian is low byte first, and network
endianness is generally big-endian.
PIXEL represents a pixel value bytesPerPixel bytes, 8XbytesPerPixel =
bits-per-pixel.

6 Economic model
6.1 PoC
6.1.1 What is contribution
The contribution definition in this system is as follows: POC is built on
the blockchain based on the cumulative contributions of user nodes,
using the node contribution degree as the access, utilizing the
uniqueness and accuracy of the distributed ledger of the blockchain to
coordinate system nodes Confirm the data broadcasting authority and
can verify the system.

6.1.2 Contribution sources

- 56 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

The entry criteria for the POC is to reach the contribution value
specified by the system. The POC starts consensus at each round, and
by contributing to the consensus vote, the working nodes are selected
to complete the block generation and accounting work, and incentives
are given, and the nodes that do not follow the rules are punished.

6.1.3 Contribution distribution
The system contribution value consists of two parts: the user node's
contribution to holding coins and the user node's work contribution.
Among them, the contribution of holding money is related to the
amount and length of holding money, and the contribution of work is
related to the effective work of participating systems.

6.1.4 How the contribution distribution method
promotes the entire network forward cycle
On-chain consensus rules, mobile democracy, predictive markets,
secondary

voting,

adaptive

arbitration

bias,

experiments

with

decentralized dispute resolution, and other new technologies that have
not yet emerged can lead the era of positive transformation of social
governance more widely.
On the one hand, the overall premise of these networks is-decentralized,
open, license-free, difficult to review, and programmable. They are
fundamentally different from past organizational models. As a result,
they are often touted as a preferred alternative to existing models.
On the other hand, as I pointed out earlier, the social and political
dynamics in a decentralized network are very similar to any other
human system. The uneven distribution of network-specific resources
inevitably leads to a power structure. At the same time, maintaining and
challenging structures becomes a decisive function of network
governance.

6.1.5 Optimal Energy Efficiency Theory of the
Whole Network

- 57 -

https://www.attnetwork.org

PoS has many notable variants, and similar models that do not
necessarily use stubs as a form of verification. For example, Trusted
Proof of Interest (DPoS) and Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DBFT)
conduct

community

elections

and

grant

verification

rights

to

stakeholder nodes. Proof of Importance (PoI) models (such as the NEM
blockchain model) mainly reward nodes for their positive contributions
to their networks (such as special payment protocols).
Although both PoW and PoS have reached the common goal of
network integrity through some form of collective verification, their
consensus methods differ significantly in concept and function, which
often have different impacts on the entire blockchain community. The
main difference between the two protocols is that PoW is temporarily
committed to computing power to help protect its network, while PoS
is temporarily committed to using existing wealth (or fairness) as a
verification tool.
PoC, as an upgrade variant of PoS, guarantees block efficiency through
node contribution while ensuring the highest possible efficiency, so that
the total energy efficiency is minimized. The potential in many different
industries (including financial technology and other industries) is so
great So that it cannot be ignored. From banking to media and
communications, certain aspects of the technology provide systems
with transparency and anonymity. The inherent immutability of the
blockchain makes it accountable to the public. In addition, distributed
applications (DApps) highlight the future of blockchain technology as a
highly democratic software development, distribution, and integration
platform.

6.2 PoR
6.2.1 What are rules
In traditional business organizations, corporate culture and company
systems, one soft and one hard, push the wheels of the organization
forward, and these cultures and systems are more or less the dominant
genes of the founder's personal genes. This kind of centralized three- 58 -

view mechanism determines the ceiling height of the company to a
certain extent. Regulating the behavior of community members is the
consensus reached by everyone's compromise. Approval takes effect,
opposition is out, support is rewarded, and violations are punished.

6.2.2 Rule use
Infrastructure management refers to embedded references to hardcoded rules to technology platforms. It usually focuses on the process
of rule execution rather than rule specification (at least with regard to
the initial rule).
For example, in the case of Ethereum, internal regulations refer to
blockchain protocols and consistent algorithms (second layer). From a
DAPP perspective, internal rules include decision-making procedures
and technical rules embedded in the relevant smart treaties (Tier 3 and
Tier 4)-given the potential exogenous nature of the Ethereum protocol.
A variety of other exogenous treaties exist, such as TCP / IP and other
Internet protocols, making it possible for people to discover and
connect with the blockchain-based Internet.
To allow these regulations to survive inside the blockchain-based
network, we will refer to the management by the infrastructure as the
management above the blockchain. These rules are programmed
directly onto the blockchain-based network, which guarantees that they
will be implemented with secure and decentralized management.
Sometimes, the management rules on the blockchain will clearly point
out and modify their own procedures: just like we can specify how to
specify laws, modify or repeal laws, we can design agreement rules and
regulations to define that can be formulated, modified or Procedures
for rescinding agreement rules.
Take Tezos as an example: a self-modifying blockchain, where people
have the ability to modify the rules of the agreement-including the
rules that modify the rules!
Infrastructure management refers to all forces that exist outside a
technology platform, but still affect its own development and operation.
These rules operate at the social and institutional level, not at the

technical level. Endogenous treaties include rules, social norms, customs,
and other management structures developed and recognized by a
specific community that promotes harmony.

6.2.3 Rule recovery
Most blockchain-based decentralized applications are divided into
different layers in their management:
1) Internet protocol layer: for example, TCP/IP protocol;
2) Blockchain technology layer: for example, the Ethereum protocol;
3) Decentralized Application (DAPP) Framework: such as DAOstack;
4) DAPP layer: for example, Sapien.
Each level implements its own management structure, which may affect
or be affected by other levels. These different levels of design and
implementation involve multiple individuals, but they come from
different communities and may or may not communicate with each
other.
Collectively, lower-level communities often implement their own
management structures and rarely consider the implementation of
upper-level management systems. However, in doing this, they
ultimately dominate how applications from the upper layers will run.

6.2.4 How the Rule Recovery Method Promotes the
Forward Cycle of the Whole Network
Developers in the open source community are more than writing rules
and procedures to decide to develop and start an open source software
project. Peer review often enforces these rules, although communities
may also implement formal enforcement and regulatory mechanisms.
Failure to comply with these rules may be excluded by community or
other forms of social punishment.

these rules are not enforced automatically: they need a third party right
to enforce and supervise.
For most blockchain communities, internal rules include all rules and
procedures that are used to decide what changes to implement in the
protocol, including decisions for the general public. In Bitcoin, these are
done through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)-this is an
informal mechanism where people can propose new features and
improvements to the Bitcoin protocol.
Ethereum implements a similar system that provides people to submit
Ethereum improvement plans (EIP). This is an informal procedure where
people can suggest and request changes to the Ethereum protocol or
code. However, these procedures are not binding. The developer
community evaluates these proposals and decides whether (and how)
they should be implemented in the code base —and the various issues
that may occur.
To the extent that these proposals are accepted and implemented in
code,

infrastructure management. In other words, because management
outside the blockchain is usually to change the rules of a potential
blockchain protocol, it has the ability to change the management
structure above the blockchain.
Exogenous rules are neither derived from the community nor their
choice, but they have the ability to influence their activities.

6.2.5 Network-wide minimum limit theory
According to Bitcoin's internal rules, the blockchain is immutable: nodes
cannot arbitrarily delete or modify content that has been recorded on
the blockchain.
There is also such a tension between the immutable nature of the
blockchain and the forgotten powers of Europe, which gives people the
right to ask for the removal and deletion of certain specific information
about them, as long as such information is deemed not to be Relevant,
outdated, or inappropriate.

The government or other relevant regulatory agencies impose these
external rules to ensure public order and morality. Their goal is to
promote specific communities or the public interest—sometimes at the
expense of the interests and norms of other communities.
