Executive Summary
1.1 Introduction to Coinme
Coinme, Inc. (“Coinme”) is a venture-backed crypto financial services and blockchain
technology company. Launched in early 2014 in Seattle, WA, Coinme was the first licensed
Bitcoin ATM operator in the United States. Since then, Coinme has grown significantly
across the western United States. In addition to operating a network of crypto ATMs, Coinme
has become a vertically integrated provider of digital wallets and an online digital currency
exchange—which provide customers the opportunity to join the crypto financial revolution.
As a fully vertically integrated company, Coinme offers a seamless user experience to
our customers. We manage all aspects of the operation including kiosk hardware and
software, state and federal licensing, regulatory compliance, real estate acquisition,
cash logistics, and customer service. This gives Coinme the flexibility to provide our
customers with an instant, on-the-spot fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat experience.
Our ATMs eliminate the uncertainty, the technical difficulty, and the lengthy waiting
period that online exchanges frequently impose on users.
Today, Coinme’s crypto ATMs provide customers with an effortless financial transaction
experience that eliminates the barriers to crypto-adoption for non-technical users. Our
long-term vision includes bringing modern access to financial services to the billions of
people who don’t have access to traditional banking services. Coinme and the crypto
community believe that providing globally ubiquitous access to crypto ATMs has the
potential to transform the world. From the developed to developing countries, Coinme

firmly believes in and espouses its tenet: “In a crypto world, all communities can rise UP.”
In order to accelerate Coinme’s vision of providing ubiquitous access to crypto ATMs, we
would like to introduce a new crypto-asset, “UpToken.” The purpose of this whitepaper is
to discuss how UpToken’s architecture plays an integral role in building a global network
of crypto ATMs.

Executive Summary

1.2

Crypto ATM Market

The amount of cryptocurrency in the markets today currently exceeds $100 billion in
value. While crypto ATMs offer the simplest and most direct portal for consumers who
want to instantly buy and sell cryptocurrencies, there are less than 1,600 crypto ATMs
deployed worldwide today. Based on these figures and given the need for geographic
accessibility, Coinme believes that there is considerable potential for the increased
ability to use crypto ATMs across the globe. Furthermore, when compared to the over 3
million traditional ATMs currently deployed worldwide, Coinme sees the appetite for and
usefulness of the new technology embedded in the newly invented UpToken for crypto
ATMs as significant and timely.

The Product

Coinme believes the widespread international growth of crypto ATMs is a significant
step towards providing a portal between government-issued fiat currencies and
cryptocurrencies, enabling global access to innovation within the financial sector. In
synch with this goal, we are launching a new crypto-asset, “UpToken” (symbol: UP).

UpToken will provide
the following
benefits to holders:

1 A 30% discount on ATM transaction fees when transaction fees are paid
using UpToken;
2 A
 customer rewards program that returns 1% of an individual’s total ATM
transaction amount back to them in the form of UpToken, much like cashback,
or other similar rewards programs in other product markets; and
3 A
 customer voting protocol for having a community voice on new
cryptocurrencies a customer is interested in having added to the ATM platform.

Crypto ATMs:
The Financial Infrastructure of the Future

2.1 	Worldwide Access to Cryptocurrencies
A global network of crypto ATMs can significantly help spread the adoption of
cryptocurrencies because the ATMs can provide easy access to secure, physical portals
for buying, selling, and transmitting cryptocurrencies. We believe that global crypto
ATMs could also pave the way for unbanked and underbanked consumers to access
financial services in fragile economies and emerging markets. Similar to how developing
counties leapfrogged landline technology with cellphone towers and smartphones,
Coinme believes underserved financial segments in developing countries have the
potential to leapfrog the absence of traditional banking institutions by choosing to use a
crypto ATM and digital wallet as the gateway to participate in financial transactions.

2.2 The Coinme Difference
Since its inception in early 2014, Coinme has adopted a conservative approach by
focusing exclusively on providing safe and secure crypto ATM services in Washington
State. Over the years, we have become fully vertically integrated, managing all aspects
of the operation including kiosk hardware and software, state and federal licensing,
regulatory compliance, real estate acquisition, cash logistics, and customer service.

Worldwide Access

A global network of crypto
ATMs can significantly
help spread the adoption
of cryptocurrencies
because they provide
easy access to secure,
physical portals for
buying, selling and
transmitting crypto
assets.

Coinme is not a plug-and-play ATM operator; our engineers write all aspects of
the software code, from the ATM firmware to the Coinme web wallet. Through the
investment of significant time and capital in research and development, Coinme has
developed what it believes to be a superior user experience. For example, when a
customer buys Bitcoin at a Coinme ATM, the customer’s funds are deposited into a
hosted Coinme wallet; Coinme’s service eliminates any need for paper wallets or thirdparty wallet applications, which can be confusing for new crypto users to understand
and adopt.
Coinme has found its crypto ATMs to be popular, and they continue to grow in
popularity. Presently, Coinme ATMs are averaging almost $100,000 in monthly
transaction volume per ATM. Coinme’s vertically integrated crypto ATM platform has
been validated by thousands of customers and is now ready to be launched in other
markets around the globe.

Contextual notes on the above graph:
• The chart is for illustrative purposes only and is solely intended to show that crypto
ATMs have apparently been seen as useful in communities where they have been
installed. This suggests that there may be appetite for the use of crypto ATMs globally.
We think this also suggests that the UpToken may be immediately useful to token
holders both in our established and new crypto ATM locations, both in the United
States and abroad.
• The periodic downward trends are largely due to the onboarding of new customers for
recently deployed ATMs. There is a lag between deployment and customer adoption that
temporarily lowers the average monthly transaction volume per ATM. Similarly, it may be
expected that downward lags will accompany the deployment of new crypto ATMs in new
jurisdictions or that have developing economies and limited financial resources.
• Coinme’s crypto ATMs are currently buy/sell bitcoin for cash only. Coinme is currently
considering adding other cryptocurrencies and payment methods (e.g., debit/credit card,
Apple Pay, etc.), as well as potentially local payment methods in developing countries and
other jurisdictions, which, together with the economic status of the jurisdiction and nature
of consumer interest, may affect monthly transaction volumes.

2.3	
How UpToken Fits with the Customer-Focused
Mission of Coinme and Its Crypto ATMs
Coinme’s customers have high standards, and Coinme wishes to meet the expectations
of its customer base. To that end, Coinme plans to continue to acquire new hardware,
develop software to support new cryptocurrencies, integrate additional payment
methods, and maintain the infrastructure, operational management, regulatory
compliance, state and federal licensing, and other business-related activities that
Coinme’s customers have come to expect. Coinme plans to have a broader network of
Crypto ATMs located across the United States, with international deployments planned
to begin in the middle of 2018 or later. Although Coinme may also enter other lines of
business, its current focus is Crypto ATMs and its customers.
The UpToken is a natural outgrowth of the customer-focused mission. As one more way
to make a Crypto ATM useful to customers, and as part of Coinme’s recent and planned
expansion of its suite of products and services, Coinme sees its new UpToken product
as a potentially attractive fit for its ATM users.

Deployment

By early October
2017, Coinme will
have a network of
39 Crypto ATMs
located throughout
the western United
States.

Coinme also intends to expand its product offerings. In the coming months, Coinme plans
to add cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin to sell and purchase from its crypto ATMs, as well
as add additional payment methods. Coinme hopes that its customers can soon travel far
and wide and find not only the convenience of our Crypto ATMs at hand, but be able to use
UpToken to more fully enjoy the experience of being a valued customer.

2.4 Coinme Plans to Hold UpToken
Coinme plans to hold 25% of all UpToken created at this address:
0x052DE51fA8d105de1F38B177030F5536b192b176 (the “Coinme UpToken Vault”).
Coinme does not intend to sell any of its UpToken in the Coinme UpToken Vault until
it has deployed at least 500 crypto ATMs. At that point, Coinme anticipates that its
expanded customer base may wish for more UpToken to be made available. During
any one month, Coinme will not sell UpToken worth more than 20% of the UpToken
distributed as loyalty rewards by the network in the previous calendar month. To
illustrate, if Coinme’s ATMs distribute the equivalent of USD $1M worth of UpToken as
rewards to ATM customers in January, in February, Coinme will sell no more than the
equivalent of USD $200k (20% of $1M) worth of UpToken.

2.5 Ongoing Communication
To keep in touch with its customer base, Coinme plans to publish regular
communications on the UpToken website (www.uptoken.org) describing ongoing
company activities, new ATM deployments where UpToken may be used, and an
overview of future initiatives. Coinme will also publish the locations of our crypto ATMs
and solicit feedback on potential future ATM locations. Furthermore, executive members
of the Coinme team will be available for ongoing communication with UpToken holders
who have questions, comments, and ideas about improving their customer experience
or that they would otherwise like to share with the company.

3.1

Discounted ATM Transaction Fees

Customers will receive a 30% discount on ATM transaction fees if they choose to use
their UpToken to pay the transaction fee. For example, if a customer purchases $1,000
of Bitcoin from a Coinme ATM and the ATM transaction fee is 5%, the customer could
choose to pay the fee from their Coinme UpToken wallet, which would reduce the
transaction fee to 3.5%. Coinme intends that customers will be eligible for the UpToken
transaction fee discount immediately upon the purchase of UpToken.
30% discount

3.2 UpToken Customer Rewards Program
Each time a customer uses a Coinme crypto ATM, Coinme will automatically deposit
UpToken into the customer’s Coinme wallet equal to 1% of their ATM transaction amount
as part of Coinme’s customer rewards program*, even if the customer elects to not
use their UpToken to pay the transaction fee. Coinme may give customers UpToken
from the Coinme UpToken Vault or, if it so decides in its discretion, a Coinme UpToken
wallet which Coinme can replenish on an as needed basis by purchasing UpToken.
Immediately upon receipt, customers will be able to use their rewarded UpToken
towards transaction fees.

Customers will
receive a 30%
discount on ATM
transaction fees if
they opt to use their
UpTokens to pay the
transaction fee.

If customers would like to purchase additional UpToken, they will be able to do so at
any Coinme ATM once Coinme finishes its UpToken software integration. Customers will
also be able to sell their UpToken at any of the Coinme ATMs for fiat currency under our
ATMs’ ordinary terms.
In addition to the 1% rewards benefit, Coinme may also reward customers with UpToken
for use of the ATM network and other services.

*The following terms will apply to UpToken customer rewards program: (1) any UpToken received through the rewards program
will not be eligible for transferring out of the customer’s Coinme UpToken wallet until the customer has accumulated a
minimum of $10,000 in total ATM transaction volume, at which point the UpToken wallet will be “unlocked,” (2) the 1% reward
will not be provided for transactions involving purchasing and selling UpToken; only transactions buying and selling nonUpToken cryptocurrencies will be provided the 1% reward, and (3) if in the future Coinme reduces transaction fees to less
than 2% of the ATM transaction amount (e.g., due to economies of scale and efficiency improvements), the reward amount
awarded through the customer rewards program benefit will not exceed 50% of the total transaction fee.

3.3	
Use UpToken to Suggest Which Cryptocurrencies
Coinme Should Support
Over time, Coinme plans to add new cryptocurrencies to the ATM network. While it is impossible to
know what the trending new cryptocurrency will be at any particular point in the future, Coinme plans
to be ready to support its customers’ wishes, and plans to hold a UpToken vote for the opportunity
to decide what cryptocurrency to add. UpToken votes for new cryptocurrencies will allow our
customers and coin enthusiasts to have their voice heard in deciding which coins, and from which coin
inventors and technologists, might become available on the crypto ATM network. Coinme plans to
ensure that, as our customer preferences evolve, our cryptocurrency offerings will evolve as well.
UpToken votes may be structured in several ways, but the current plan is to set up an
UpToken address for each candidate cryptocurrency. For example, there could be an address
for Bitcoin Cash, another for Litecoin, etc. Coinme plans that anyone holding UpToken will be
able to send UpToken to those addresses to recommend adoption of their desired candidate
cryptocurrency. When the election period is over, Coinme will take account of its customers’
wishes and, unless it finds the decision unreasonable in light of developments (such as
that a candidate cryptocurrency becomes unusable due to unforeseen events), plans to
begin a process of adding the cryptocurrency to become available on the crypto ATMs.
The losing voters’ UpToken will be returned to the losing voters’ wallets. As for the winning
voters’ UpToken, they will be deposited into the Coinme UpToken Vault. The winning voters’
UpToken that Coinme receives will be subject to the same restrictions as the UpToken in the
vault as described in Section 2.4, as well as the additional restriction that the winning voters’
UpToken will be held in the Coinme UpToken Vault for at least five years after the election has
ended. After the election, Coinme plans to fulfill its customers’ request by seeking to add the
winning coin to Coinme’s network of ATMs in a commercially reasonable timeframe. All such
elections will be publicly announced on the UpToken website: www.uptoken.org

Overtime, Coinme

cryptocurrencies to

Auctions will be
held, and interested
parties will use
UpToken to vote.

3.4 Technical Design: Simple & Secure
UpToken is an Ethereum token following the ERC20 protocol. We will take a conservative
design approach in order to minimize the attack surface that complicated smart contracts
present to hackers around the world. Furthermore, we chose not to use an advanced
contract token architecture to minimize the number of ways the token and token-holders
can be attacked.
Our token contract is available to view here www.uptoken.org/contract and is described
in our token sale terms here: www.uptoken.org/terms
