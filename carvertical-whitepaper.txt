1. Overview [TL;DR]
● Automotive market is growing. Aftermarket is growing to an even larger
extent.
● Used vehicles change multiple owners and multiple countries. Real
vehicle history does not exist, because car data does not travel as fast
as cars do.
● The lack of trusted vehicle history generates perfect ecosystem for
unfair practices, which in turn generates false vehicle value.
● Because of false value and unreliable vehicle history data, insurance
companies overcharge for taking risks, therefore consumers overpay
for it.
● Vehicles generate a large amount of data which is monetized by third
parties.
● Data is owned by its creator, hence vehicle owner is the owner of data
generated by their vehicle. However, today vehicle owner has no real
control over data the vehicle generates.
● We collect vehicle history, store it in blockchain and give back the
control to the owner of the vehicle.
● We are building tools and products for vehicles to generate more
trusted data which is then added to blockchain.
● We are creating incentive mechanisms for owners, so that they could
get value for data their vehicles generate.
● All data goes into creating a trusted, tamper-proof, and decentralized
vehicle history registry.
● By using vehicle history we are building a decentralized mechanism for
transparently calculating vehicle value.

5

● History, reports, and value calculations will be sold to parties in need
and vehicle owners, as content creators, will be rewarded.
● This will bring transparency and trust to the used car market.

2. Which Specific Problems Are We
Addressing?
2.1 Scattered Data
Vehicle data is scattered across multiple sources and the only way to get a
whole picture about a true state of the vehicle is by gathering it piece by
piece. There are at least 7 primary car history parts:
● The accuracy of odometer readings
● Information about prior damage (as a result of various accidents)
● Maintenance records
● The number of previous owners
● The legal status of a vehicle (e.g. stolen)
● Possible ownership restrictions (e.g. liens)
● Archive photos
Each of these parts is scattered across a number of sources which, on top of
that, differ depending on country or region.

2.2 Unwillingness to Disclose Data or Limited Availability of
Information
None of the parties holding data about vehicles are willing to disclose it.
Some data is closely linked to personal data, even though all of it can be
depersonalized.

Only

a

vehicle

owner

has

rights

to

their

data.

6

Unfortunately, in this area, content creators have no incentives to get their
data, as they have no use for it. This is closely linked to the fact that
organizations holding automotive data do not provide tools for data owners
to collect it.

This is yet another reason for today’s multi-billion car fraud business.

2.3 Inter-country Data Loss or Absence of Synced Regulations
between Countries
Organizations within a country do not have infrastructure to share
information in real time. The situation is even worse on the inter-country
scale. Today's problems, economy, and used vehicle market are rapidly
becoming more global. Centralized organizations which hold important data
cannot catchup with the fast progress of globalization trends. As a result,
every country (and every entity within the country) has its own rules for
gathering and managing the data, and usually those rules are not aligned
among different states.
The time gap between deregistering a vehicle in one country and registering
it in another usually marks a grey area where previous accidents are hidden
and mileages are clocked.

7

2.4 Various Nature of Data Makes It Difficult to Draw
Conclusions or Get Market-specific Insights
Every organization, entity, and country has different data formats. Even basic
units of length have not been unified yet (Germany has kilometers, the UK miles, Sweden - Swedish miles). This creates even more difficulties in
unifying vehicle history in today's global market. Getting complete
conclusions and insights is practically impossible.

2.5 Unfair Trade Practices Defined by Law, but Hardly
Traceable in Terms of Timing
There are laws protecting against these fraudulent and unfair practices. At
the same time these law enforcement agencies are being blocked by simple
lack of trusted information. Falsifying documents or tampering the odometer
can be done much more quickly than it can be detected by law enforcement.
After these falsifications, a vehicle is sold and link between the fraud and the
person who commits it is lost.

2.6 Lack of Trusted Source for Vehicle Value
Today, there is no trusted way to calculate vehicle value. Vehicles are
evaluated privately, with questionable data, and low accuracy by people who
mainly base their decisions on personal experience.
Accuracy, transparency, and trust are vitally important in this area as a lot of
expensive decisions are made according to this number.

8

3. Deep Dive into solution
carVertical is blockchain-based vehicle history registry. We collect large
quantity of information from a lot of different trusted sources, organize it in
the form of records and store it in blockchain. We then feed this information
into our data analysis stack, which, by using machine learning and advanced
mathematical models, calculates the real value. Most of our elements will be
open sourced and our system will be moving to full decentralization to
preserve transparency. We will incentivize and empower users to easily
collect and get rewarded for the data they own. They are content creators.

9

3.1 Data first
There are three main data source categories:
● IoT miners;
● Data accessible to only a vehicle owner;
● Trusted sources;

3.1.1 IoT miners
We are working with an industry-leading IoT device manufacturer to create
the 1st version of carVertical miner. Installing these miners into your vehicle
OBD slot will generate a stream of real time information which will be sent to
our data farm for processing. In exchange, the owner of a miner will receive
tokens as a reward.

10

3.1.2 Data Accessible to Only Vehicle Owner
There is a number of data sources which can only be reached by a vehicle
owner. We are working with advisors and partners to create ways for users
to grant us access to such data in exchange for tokens. Primary sources of
such information are local registries. Data will be depersonalized, securely
stored, and encrypted. We do not need personal data. Only the data owner
will be able to unlock and grant access to such information in exchange for
tokens. This will allow user to control and receive value for their information.

Every vehicle data exchange will have to pass Ethereum smart contract to be
validated and unlocked. We are using Merkle tree with Merkle reduce list to
store final state of vehicle data in Ethereum.

11

3.1.3 Trusted Sources
Most of the vehicle history records are stored in closed and private
databases. We are onboarding insurance, business fleets, state registries,
classifieds, auctions, law enforcement agencies, and workshops to open
vehicle data for vehicle owners. Such data exchange is in the best of interest
to all parties: the owners who officially hold data and businesses that need
this data to benefit. All exchanges will be done with carVertical token.

3.2 Vehicle Value
We are building a decentralized and open-sourced vehicle value calculation
service. It will use information owned by users and will provide trusted, open,
and collaborative source of true vehicle value. This is in high demand by a lot
of service providers, such as insurance companies, car mortgage providers,
leasing services, and many more. Frauds and inaccuracy are usually very
expensive for such companies, while additional price is usually overpaid by
customers.

3.3 History Reports and Insights
Our system will examine a vehicle's data, technical specifications, and other
records, and provide the history of details, insights, as well as future
predictions for the vehicle. Using these reports we are bringing trust and
transparency into today’s chaotic, unfair and, very often, fraudulent secondhand vehicle market.

12

4. Business Model
One world - one decentralized registry for all vehicles. This is an
unprecedented case. We are building a company which will allow users to
truly own, control, and benefit from the data their vehicles generate.

Our company's healthy life cycle is calculated on the soft cap of the ICO
3050 Ethereum. This amount of money could help us safely build a company
and run it for 5 years only developing products. We aim to start a revenue
flow in a few months after we close the ICO with carVertical.reports (section
4.2). Another product carVertical.WhiteLabel (section 4.3) will add income to
cash flow in 13 months after completing the ICO and carVertical.API (section
4.4) in 15 months. For detailed cash flow execution please check cash flow
analysis (5.2).

The main goal of the ICO: the hard cap of 15050 Ethereum is the most
rational budget for our company’s 5 years runway with maximized marketing
expenses. Additional budget gives us leverage to onboard databases of
more different countries earlier and start selling our products in these
countries.
Producing car’s history blockchain registry will enable our team to build four
different products which will fully utilize blockchain technology, the token of
our company, and will be the core elements of a stable cash flow.

13

4.1 carVertical.Wallet
Wallet is our front product. It will serve as a gateway to most of our services.
It will directly communicate with Ethereum blockchain as well as other helper
services. It is a mobile gateway to virtually manage your car's registration
and maintenance records, perform insurance or technical inspection tasks,
access marketplace, and manage access to your data Wallet functionality:
● Closed information access control
● Claiming vehicle
● Marketplace
● Notifications
Monetization: service providers will have to pay cV Tokens to offer their
services to vehicle owners. cV Tokens will be bought with FIAT from the pool
or in exchange from other token holders.

14

4.1.2 Closed Information Access Control
There is a number of record types in vehicle history. Users are able to control
who can access which records, as well as enable public access to some of
them.

4.1.3 Claiming vehicle
By claiming a vehicle, you will register it as your property. A record will be
kept in Ethereum blockchain. This will make you the owner of any data
related to that vehicle. You will receive tokens when this data will be used.

15

Registration process will include verifying your identity to the public key of
your wallet. Users will have to use Civic (we will implement more identity
services later) to verify their identity (we will not be handling any personal
data). And, after that, you will have to confirm that the vehicle you are
claiming is officially registered to your name. This is done via your local
vehicle registry. We are working with advisors to create such possibility in
countries where it does not exist.

4.1.4 Marketplace
This is going to be a new way to use and manage outside services needed
to run your vehicle smoothly. Buying/renewing insurance, ordering service
checks, maintenance, and much more. Since we are going to have detailed
information about vehicle and its status, service providers will be able to
accurately target vehicles which require certain services. Targeting will cost
tokens. Vehicle owners will be able to pay using tokens they currently own
and receive discounts according to the amount of tokens they hold.
Marketplace will be built with Ardor (an evolved version of NXT) blockchain.

4.1.5 Notifications
We will be able to notify users about the number of events which our
Machine Learning will derive from the data:
● Insurance renewal
● Tech inspection
● Vehicle issue (IoT)
● Maintenance checkup
● Recommended oil change

16

● Seasonal tire change
● … and more, according to other parameters

4.1.6 Public data and data exchange
We would like to participate in such initiatives as IPDB [ipdb.io]. Users will be
able to mark some records as viable for public use, such as odometer
readings or minified versions of other records, as well as add integration via
Ocean protocol [oceanprotocol.com]. This would provide users with more
ways of benefiting from their data.

4.2 carVertical.reports
By utilizing this product we want to satisfy supply/demand for people who
want to buy a second-hand car and car dealers. We will provide a unified
and easy-to-read report which includes full car history and specific
information about that particular vehicle.

17

More than 1.900.000 search queries about car VIN number check-up are
estimated every month. And people get access to only low quality databases
with dodgy and unreliable results, we are changing that.

Monetization: fixed price per report & bulk report offers

4.3 carVertical.WhiteLabel
We feel the need to spread and ensure easy access to this registry for as
many people as possible. Our belief is that the fastest way to do so is giving
correct tools, which will help to localize and spread access, to others. Even if
you have a good team, car history register database is quite difficult to
establish as a B2C business model and it also is time-consuming. We will
provide white label (franchise model) solution to everyone who wants to run
such business on their own.
For a monthly fee we will provide a white label buyer with:
● Website templates
● - Automatic report development system
● - CMS (content management system)
● - CRM system (customer relationship management)
● - API;
● - Payment processing

18

The buyer will only need to figure out how to create marketing for their
product and selected country or region, and start earning revenue.

More than 1.300.000 people worldwide look for white label (franchise)
business

opportunities

every

month.

Creating

such

product

as

carVertical.WhiteLabel is a great solution to satisfy this demand and give
online entrepreneurs an opportunity to start their local car VIN number
check-up business.
Monetization: fixed monthly subscription depending on quantity of reports
generated.

19

4.4 carVertical.API
Big and medium size companies are always in a great need to expand their
data sources.

Such companies as insurance, leasing or claim handling services buy plenty
of database services every day to make their job easier. For big companies
more data sources in their everyday job mean lower financing loss at the end
of

the

year.

carVertical.API is a product for big fish. We will provide them with an API
(application programing interface) to get a really easy access to history,

20

report and value calculation services. An API can be easily integrated into
their in-house systems and supported all the time from our side.

Monetization: b2b monthly fee + for a quantity of API calls.

5.4 SWOT Analysis

Strengths
1. carVertical is a blockchain registry. This means that data cannot be
changed, faked, rewritten or manipulated.
2. carVertical is the first solution in the world which took blockchain-based
approach to the car history sector.
3. Our team has a team member who has worked in car history database
market for years.
4. Blockchain for our products automatically guarantees trust and
transparency as a unique selling proposition.
5. Three products (.reports, .WhiteLabel & .API) will guarantee a stable
cashflow for our company in a very short time after ICO.
6. Our carVertical.Wallet product will feature an integration with Civic Identity
Verification process. It is becoming an industry standard.
7. carVertical.WhiteLabel product will guarantee a faster spread of our
blockchain registry all over the world.
8. Performance team! Faster than autoDNA and more technologically
advanced than CARFAX.

23

Weaknesses
1. Data gathering starts from scratch. In the case of scraped information, it
will take about 2 years for it to become valuable.
2. It will also take some time to overcome some VIN-checking services
which are well-known on the regional level.

Opportunities
1. carVertical.API product will not only guarantee possibility to approach and
sell blockchain registry to big companies, but also turn them into our data
sources.
2. From marketing perspective, it is always easier to penetrate such market
which does not want to change and innovate itself.
3. carVertical is the first blockchain-based car history solution. It means a
great potential to become an industry standard.
4. carVertical also has an opportunity to become the first global vehicle
registry.

Threats
1. carVertical most heavily relies on Ethereum, as that is where the registry
will be stored. Any threat to Ethereum is a threat to carVertical.
2. As trust in ICOs is in fast decline, we might raise money slower, which will
slow down the product development.

24

3. Legislation. Some countries treat VIN as personal information. Not clear,
but EU might enforce directive that states VIN as personal information. This
might make getting and storing information more difficult as we will need to
conform to more standarts.

6. Token Sale & Token Model
In this section, we are going to summarize the process of carVertical token
model, distribution & utilization. More detailed terms and conditions will be
set out in the terms and conditions of the carVertical token sale which will be
made available on our website www.carvertical.io.

6.1 The Purpose of carVertical Token
carVertical token is NOT AN ASSET, NOR A SECURITY. It is a utility token.
carVertical tokens do not represent or confer any ownership right or stake,
share, security, or equivalent rights, or any right to receive dividends, other
payments, intellectual property rights, or any other form of participation in or
relating to the project described in this white paper and/or in carVertical or
any of its affiliates. The holders of carVertical token are only entitled to use
carVertical products as described in this document if successfully
developed, or to resell the tokens.

The cV token itself will be based on Ethereum, a blockchain-based
computing platform. Ethereum allows smart contracts – distributed
computer programs which can facilitate online contractual agreements in a
cryptographically secure manner. Smart contracts are what enables the

25

existence of carVertical token as a truly transparent and decentralized
service. This technology also ensures that carVertical removes the need for
intermediaries and having a central authority you need to trust, through
smart contracts, the complex process of choosing peers, tracking delivery
and facilitating bidding/payment can be described in the contract itself, while
still running on the distributed Ethereum network and taking advantage of
the blockchain qualities.

cV are distributed and kept on the main Ethereum network. To optimize the
transaction cost and performance, all micro transactions are processed offchain and only the final stakes are returned to the Ethereum network. We
believe in the idea of keeping tokens on Ethereum and see it as a bank
platform, and an excellent platform to enter exchange markets.

6.2 How Is Token Going to be Used in carVertical?
The usage of a cV token described by product:

carVertical.Wallet:
A person can earn cV by using carVertical.Wallet product. The person will
earn a small amount of cV by downloading the carVertical.Wallet mobile
application,

confirming

their

identity

with

Civic

identity

verification

blockchain, and confirming their car’s ownership with their country's national
car registry. Using wallet user will be able to provide access to his/her data
kept by third parties, which will earn additional tokens. Also, there will be

26

some referral programs for carVertical.Wallet with a small amount of cV
tokens as a reward.

Service or product providers will need to pay cV tokens (or other crypto or
FIAT currency) for a possibility provided by carVertical to make offers (e.g.
insurance offer) to the carVertical.Wallet users.

A carVertical.Wallet user will be able to buy service or products from
providers by paying a cV token (or other crypto or FIAT currency).
carVertical.Reports:
A person or a company will be able to purchase a report about a particular
car by using a cV token (or other crypto or FIAT currency).

carVertical.WhiteLabel:
A person or a company will be able to buy a carVertical.WhiteLabel solution
by using cV token (or other crypto or FIAT currency) and start their own car
VIN checkup business in their country.

carVertical.API:
A person or a company will be able to buy a carVertical.API solution by using
cV token (or other crypto or FIAT currency) access carVertical database by
provided API solution and easily integrate our data to their systems.

27

cV Token graphic flow:

6.3 Rules of ICO
carVertical will launch only ONE public initial coin offering (ICO) during which
a token sale will be held. It will take place on https://www.carvertical.io. The
ICO will start on the date which will be determined soon. Contributors who
plan to purchase up to 2,5 ETH worth of cV will not be required to get
whitelisted. The hard cap of the carVertical ICO is 15050 ETH. The soft cap 3050 ETH. The pre ICO stage is 1050 ETH.

28

carVertical public token sale will be executed in 6 waves. The first wave is
considered a pre-ICO and is worth 1050 ETH. All funds contributed during
the pre-ICO wave will be used for marketing & legal expenses of the
carVertical ICO campaign.

Wave 2 (2000 ETH) is considered the soft cap (Total with Wave 1 - 3050
ETH). If the company does not reach soft cap (End of Wave 2), all
contributions will be refunded. In such case only contributors that
participated in wave 2 will get their contributions back. All pre-ICO (wave 1)
contributors will not be able to refund their donations.

All waves will be executed by ERC-20 standard and the token sale will be
distributed via smart contracts on the Ethereum Network. The smart contract
will cover all six waves including pre-ICO stage (Wave 1). The smart contract
will automatically close in 100 days after the start of first wave. carVertical
Tokens will be distributed to all contributors only after the end date of the
smart contract or if the token crowdsale reaches its hard cap (15050 ETH).

29

Individual maximum purchase cap - 2000 ETH, individual minimum purchase
cap - 0,1 ETH.

Rules of ICO 30: Additionally, during the registration an intended to be used
Ethereum wallet address should be provided. It will be used for transferring
ether and receiving carVertical tokens. The address provided and beneficiary
address must be the same. One contributor will be able to make only one
transfer. The wallet must be ERC-20 approved. A list of recommended
wallets is provided below.

DO

NOT

PARTICIPATE

IN

TOKEN

SALES

DIRECTLY

FROM

CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE ADDRESSES. YOU NEED A TOKEN
COMPATIBLE ETHEREUM WALLET.

cV will be transferred after the reach of the soft cap. When the soft cap is
reached, the cV will be transferred immediately after the transaction is made.
During the ICO, carVertical tokens will be locked, until the end of the

30

ICO. cV will be listed in exchanges in 6-16 weeks after the ICO is finished. If
not all the cV are sold during our token sale, the remaining tokens will be
shared to all ICO (43%) contributors proportionally. These tokens will be
transferred when a person makes a transaction using carVertical token. Any
transaction will be applicable, even to the same wallet. In an unlikely event, if
the soft cap is not reached, contributors will get refunded automatically
(except wave 1 - soft cap).

6.4 What Is KYC and Why Is it Needed?
COMPANY WILL EXECUTE POST FACT KYC PROCESS. KYC PROCESS WILL BE
EXECUTED ONLY FOR THAT PART OF CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH WILL BE
CONVERTED TO FIAT AND TRANSFFERED TO BANK.

The primary objective of token sale registration is to enforce a mandatory
Know-Your-Customer (KYC) check to prevent identity theft, terrorist

31

financing, money laundering, and financial fraud. It also allows our team to
understand our token holders better and manage risks prudently.
At carVertical we take social responsibility very seriously, thus, we believe
that it is important to play our part in combating money laundering and
terrorism financing. That is why we have benchmarked ourselves to the
same KYC standards typically adopted by banks and financial institutions
globally. The due diligence process includes screening against international
sanction/terrorist lists, politically exposed persons, and people with adverse
reputation. Risk assessment and onboarding outcome will be performed and
determined through the use of a proprietary software. The KYC process is
comprised of two parts, in the following order:
1. Automated. Your details, as provided by you, will be checked against
public sanctions and alert lists. This step will be performed by a KYC
solution firm based in Singapore.
2. Manual. If the automated step is successful, we will manually verify that
the information provided matches the identification document photos
submitted by you.

6.5 Privacy and Security during KYC
Our members’ privacy and security are of utmost importance to us. As such,
please find below the measures which will be employed to ensure your
privacy and security:

1. Only an encrypted version of your data is stored in our public servers. The
decryption key is stored in a private server. The public servers cannot initiate

32

connections to this private server. All decryption happens in our private
server which only the founding team has access to.

hash of each email will be stored in those servers. All emails sent in regards
to the registration processes will be sent from the private server.

6.8 Are carVertical Tokens Securities?
No, carVertical tokens are not and are not intended to be securities, financial
instruments, or investment products of any kind.
For example, with purposes of financial regulation in the European Union a
“security” is often defined with a reference to “transferable security” within
the meaning of the EU Directive on markets in financial instruments
(MiFID)[1]. According to MiFID, “transferable securities” means those classes
of securities which are negotiable on the capital market, with an exception of
instruments of payment, such as:

(a) shares in companies and other securities equivalent to shares in
companies, partnerships or other entities, and depositary receipts in respect
of shares;

(b) bonds or other forms of securitized debt, including depositary receipts in
respect of such securities;

(c) any other securities giving the right to acquire or sell any such
transferable securities or giving rise to a cash settlement determined by

38

reference to transferable securities, currencies, interest rates or yields,
commodities or other indices or measures.

carVertical does not qualify as “transferable security” for the above
purposes. carVertical as a utility token in the future will only provide
opportunity to access carVertical services of. The aim of the carVertical
token is to make it possible for people to buy carVertical products as well as
with other crypto or FIAT currency.

If carVertical was not based on the blockchain technology, it would be
similar to purchasing a ticket or other document which proves that the
person has a right to use a particular service.

7. Industry Trends
So far, the automotive community seems to be excited about blockchain
evolvement. Some promising new cooperation possibilities and ventures
have arisen, and they rush to provide various solutions to the market. It is
not a product phase yet, but rather proofs of concept.

For example, Volkswagen Financial Services (VWFS), coupled with several
partners, is developing CarPass in an effort to centralize all information
about a car to a shared immutable and transparent database, immune to
fraud or falsification. Telemetry and sensor data introduce all manner of
possibility in what could be registered on such a ledger.

39

Toyota has also announced a plan to use blockchain to amass driving data
which will help them to develop driverless cars. The Japanese manufacturer
is working on developing applications and proofs of concept for three areas
of the new mobility ecosystem: driving/testing data sharing, car/ride share
transactions, and usage-based insurance.

Other major automakers, including Porsche, Daimler, and Renault, have also
taken steps to investigate or integrate blockchain technology. For instance,
in April 2017, Porsche launched a competition inviting blockchain start-ups
to suggest how blockchain technology could be applied to its business.
According to Frost & Sullivan, participants in the automotive sector are
expected to spend approximately 0.6% of their total IT spend on blockchain
technology by 2025. Ranging from supply chain management to leasing, a
variety of automotive industry verticals have been identified, where
blockchain has the potential to be a disruptor. The industry is, therefore,
beginning to build momentum to experience blockchain penetration outside
of an R&D or a lab setting.

9. Product development timeline
The carVertical ICO will start on 26th of December 2017 and end on 4th of
April 2018 or when it hit hard cap. During the 2018, we will develop a working
carVertical product (web product and apps), which can cover B2C, B2B &
Public access parts of the business model. From January 2018, we will start
on-boarding different local and global databases and registers which belong
to countries or private owners and start getting revenue on June 2018.

10. For Contributors
6 subjective arguments proving why carVertical Token valueis
going to grow in the future
1. carVertical is projected to start generating revenue from its products in July
2018. Our cash flow analysis states that in five years we will hit a revenue of
27,204,000 EUR with EBITDA of 10,524,000 EUR.

2. Token will be the only way to buy carVertical services. Stacking comes in
place: person who owns more carVertical tokens gets significant discounts
when buying our products. That means cheaper API calls, reports, whitelabel,
car insurance and other services.

3. carVertical Token value will directly correlate with effectiveness of our
service. Effectiveness of the service will be determined by efficiency of our
machine learning and mathematical models. Machine

learning

and

mathematical models will get better over time with more data.

4. The users carVertical onboards generate more and more data over time.
So the value of the token will grow exponentially with the number of users we
will onboard.

5. The team is already building this product. ICO came as an opportunity, not
as a goal. This proves that carVertical is not just another ICO. We have
signed agreement with Diginet, biggest classifieds website group in Baltic
states, to deliver white label solution for their auto classified sites.

48

6. All national and privately held registries will move to blockchain in a few
years. We’re going to be the first “sitting at the table” when governments and
big companies come searching for the solutions to their needs.
