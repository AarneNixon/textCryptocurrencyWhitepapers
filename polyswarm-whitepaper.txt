PolySwarm in 60 Seconds
Polyswarm is a decentralized threat intelligence market
made possible by Ethereum smart contracts and blockchain
technology.
Polyswarm incentivizes rapid innovation in the $8.5B/yr anti-virus and
automated cyber threat intelligence space with precise economic incentives that
reward timely and accurate threat intelligence concerning the malintent of files,
network traffic and URLs.
PolySwarm defines a real-time threat detection ecosystem involving
enterprises, consumers, vendors and geographically-diverse security
experts. Experts develop and hone competing “micro-engines” that
autonomously investigate the latest threats, attempting to outperform
their competition. PolySwarm’s “Proof of Work” is threat detection
accuracy: the market rewards experts who are best able to defend
enterprises and end users.
Relative to today’s ad hoc market, PolySwarm will lower the barrier
to entry, provide broader coverage options, discourage duplicative
effort and ensure interoperability among products and threat
intelligence feeds.
Economically, PolySwarm functions as a skill-required twist on a
prediction market2 with thousands of micro-engines (“workers”)
investigating the latest in malware evolution at machine speed - no
human in the loop.
PolySwarm will be developed by PolySwarm Pte. Ltd. with funding
derived from the sale of ERC20-compatible Nectar (“NCT”) utility
tokens.
As a utility token, PolySwarm economically disincentivizes Nectar
speculation by rewarding honest market participation through the
collection and distribution of Fees (details on page 6) to valueadding, active participants.

Background
Today’s enterprises rely on an ad-hoc mixture of anti-virus subscriptions,
threat intelligence feeds, and assorted dynamic analysis engines to defend
against evolving adversarial cyber activity. Users must weigh the benefits and
drawbacks presented by each solution and decide on the least-worst fit for
their environment.
Today’s market discourages solutions that provide broad threat
coverage.
Today’s solutions focus on a comfort zone of threats - a direct
result of today’s market economics.

Figure A: The black rectangle represents all the threats an Enterprise may encounter; white
circles are anti-virus product #1 and #2, respectively.

It’s easy (and perhaps justifiable) to ignore an anti-virus solution
that doesn’t detect WannaCry3, but in doing so, today’s market
effectively rewards overlapping coverage among vendors - a market
inefficiency that causes duplicative cost. This is a classic tragedy of
the commons situation.
Similarly, consider a vendor that chooses to develop expertise outside
of this comfort zone. If the comfort zone is defined by the set of
threats faced by most enterprises, sales for this specialized vendor
will be difficult. How do you convince a potential customer that they

p. 04

3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack
Version 15

will have to deal with malware that you are uniquely qualified to
detect / prevent / mitigate?
Finally, defenders cannot mix and match many of today’s solutions,
making combinatorial coverage impossible in many scenarios.
In contrast, PolySwarm will foster an ecosystem of broad coverage
powered by 1000s of “micro-engine” workers, authored by
geographically diverse security experts.

Figure B: PolySwarm will foster an ecosystem that produces broad threat coverage.

PolySwarm provides a legitimate revenue stream for security
experts.
When local economics cannot support sufficient honest work, some
security experts develop ransomware, operate bots and otherwise use
their skills for evil. PolySwarm provides a region-free alternative:
unencumbered reward for honest work. Experts compete to make the
internet a safer place.
PolySwarm puts the user first.
The PolySwarm market directs economic incentives to where it matters
most: toward accurate malintent detection (“threat intelligence”).
Accuracy is determined via a novel process we call Mediated
Consensus (details on page 10).
In short, PolySwarm provides users with timely access to broad,
crowdsourced security expertise. Need to quickly triage a suspect
file? Just Swarm ItTM.

Version 15

Reinventing the Threat Intelligence
Market
PolySwarm's Nectar ("NCT") tokens form the basis of a new market that
introduces novel instruments for satisfying demand for timely and accurate
assertions regarding the malintent of files, network traffic, and URLs,
collectively referred to as Artifacts. These new instruments are structured
to directly incentivize innovation in the threat intelligence space with a
feedback loop driven by accurate results.

Enterprises

Experts

Ambassadors

Arbiters

PolySwarm employs Fees to discourage spam and incentivize honest
and active market engagement. Fees are assessed on transaction
types that may be abused for spam, and then distributed to active
ecosystem participants; those who are introducing Artifacts and
determining ground truth regarding the malintent of Artifacts. This
participation is measured in a sliding window fashion, “ageing-off”
older market contributions, thereby incentivizing continued market
participation.
PolySwarm 1.0 (and this document) will focus exclusively on boolean
(malicious / benign) determination, but the PolySwarm team has
bigger plans than disrupting boolean malintent determination. During
PolySwarm 1.0 development, the team will investigate methods to
incentivize the production of artifact metadata such as malware
family and how core PolySwarm concepts such as smart contract
market design, Mediated Consensus and an information security focus
can disrupt related markets such as vulnerability bug bounties4.
Before introducing PolySwarm’s instruments, we introduce the
participant classes that will utilize them.

Figure C: Overview of PolySwarm’s Bounty and Offer lifecycles.

End Users: Enterprise and home users with suspect Artifacts. End Users
participate in the PolySwarm market via Bounties and Offers (more on these
in a moment) and extract timely and accurate malintent classifications
Security Experts (“Experts”): Geographically diverse malware experts
and reverse engineers. Experts dissect the latest suspect Artifacts and
maintain PolySwarm-connected detection engines (“workers”) that determine
malintent. Experts commit to “Assertions”, public statements that reflect the
results of their analysis into the malintent of the Artifact. Those that have
committed an accurate Assertion are rewarded (in NCT) for their efforts.
As far as core participants go, that’s actually it. Simplicity
is good, but this is pretty far from the full PolySwarm story.
Technically, PolySwarm could work with only these two classes of
participants. Realistically, it won’t because most End Users will
prefer to outsource the nitty gritty of interfacing with the PolySwarm
market. Before going further, we must introduce Ambassadors
(another participant) and a certain subclass of these Ambassadors.

p. 07

Version 15

Ambassadors: Companies that make it easy for End Users to benefit from
the PolySwarm market. Ambassadors collect traditional fiat (e.g. subscription
fees) and suspect Artifacts from their clients (End Users) and introduce
Bounties and Offers into the market on their clients’ behalf. It is the
Ambassador’s responsibility to distill the Assertions of various Experts into a
simple malicious or benign Verdict that they deliver to their clients.
A trivial, perhaps naive approach for this distillation might be to
simply average the Assertions provided by Experts. It is unlikely,
however, that such an algorithm would compete favorably against a
Bayesian analysis5, let alone expert human involvement. We expect
existing Antivirus and threat intelligence firms to participate in the
PolySwarm market as early Ambassadors, augmenting their in-house
expertise with PolySwarm-enabled triage of suspect Artifacts.
From the User’s perspective, upgrading to PolySwarm-backed
protection is an easy process: choose a reputable Ambassador and
pay a subscription fee.
An Ambassador’s reputation is based on past Verdict performance
relative to ground truth. Ambassadors are incentivized to make their
Verdicts public due to their inherent desire to build reputation and
attract new clients, as well as take advantage of a discount on
Fees (this process is detailed later). These public Verdicts enable
the creation of an Ambassador “scorecard” that rates real-world
performance against non-synthetic Artifacts with data that is simply
not available in today’s market6.

Arbiters: Top-echelon Ambassadors that are responsible for determining
malintent ground truth. A certain percentage of Ambassadors (in terms of
Fees generated) will be considered “Arbiters”.
During development, PolySwarm will assign Arbitership to existing,
reputable threat intelligence vendors that are willing to maintain
frequent engagement with the PolySwarm team, help identify and
address platform bugs, and help build interest in the ecosystem.
Once PolySwarm 1.0 is ready for launch, these designated Arbiters
will need to maintain top-echelon Ambassador volumes to maintain
Arbiter status.

Version 15

Prediction Markets, Arbiters &
Mediated Consensus
In the PolySwarm ecosystem, Security Experts develop micro-engine
workers that compete to quickly & accurately investigate suspect artifacts.
This investigation occurs at machine speed - well before the ground truth
concerning an artifact’s malintent has been established.
This design shares some similarities with prediction markets, i.e.
rewarding past assertions based on accuracy, but differs in two
critical respects:
1. No future data is required to accurately classify an artifact.
The “correct” answer to whether an artifact is malicious can always
be determined with certainty at the time it is made available to
workers. PolySwarm is a skill-based design where nothing is left to
chance7.
2. Determining ground truth will always require expertise. This is
in contrast to the “universal observability” of prediction markets
(including crypto markets such as Augur8) that rely on unskilled
participants to observe and record events as they occur.
Item #1 is PolySwarm’s gambling deterent9.
Item #2 introduces a technical challenge: what is the best way
to incentivize authorities to continually produce ground truth?
PolySwarm’s answer is the Arbiter class and a process we refer to as
Mediated Consensus.
Mediated Consensus is a generic design paradigm that we hope will
find a home in other market design projects. In short, Mediated
Consensus is market design that entrusts a critical task to a subset
of participants. These participants:
1. Are qualified to complete the task (possess expertise).
2. Have their interests aligned with the overall health of the market
(avoiding tragedy of the commons).

p. 09

7 In theory. In practice, at least two events may introduce uncertainty:
(1) arbiters incorrectly determine ground truth resulting in reward
distribution to wrong experts, (2) the expert’s analysis is accurate
according to ground truth, but the expert disagrees on the boundaries of
malintent - a semantic issue that is larger than PolySwarm. Is adware
malware or simply a potentially unwanted application? Neither of these
variables fundamentally detracts from the skill-based nature of the
PolySwarm ecosystem.
8 https://augur.net/
9 Guessing, betting, gambling or other chance-based wagers on
artifact malintent is bad for everyone and PolySwarm is specifically
designed to be inhospitable to this misuse of the platform.

Version 15

We’ve designed Arbiters to satisfy these two constraints. By
definition, the Arbiter class is defined as the most active
Ambassadors in the PolySwarm ecosystem at any given time.
As Ambassadors, Arbiters are contracted by their customers to
distill Security Experts’ assertions into Verdicts. Customers trust
them to possess and exercise automated - and when necessary human expertise. These companies already have a vested interest in
maintaining a public record of accuracy (item #1).
As the most active Ambassadors, Arbiters have the most to gain /
lose by an honest / dishonest PolySwarm ecosystem. Their large stake
in the faith of the ecosystem aligns their financial interests with the
health of the market (item #2).
We’ve designed Fees as a supplemental defense against Arbiter abuse
such as Arbiter-Security Expert collusion.

Determining Ground Truth
Most of the technical details of the Arbiter voting process are intentionally
left undefined at this time. The reason for this is simple: the specifics of the
Arbiter decision process are predicated on the specifics of virtually all other
PolySwarm processes - and we expect variations in other processes.
That being said, we expect the following high level design choices to
provide value in this process:
1. Arbiters reach consensus on ground truth via a majority vote.
2. These votes are mined onto the Ethereum chain en masse (many
votes per cycle), saving time and money (Ethereum gas) for the
PolySwarm ecosystem.
3. To encourage participation, Arbiters are rewarded with Fees for
voting on the ground truth of artifacts.
4. Arbiters may abstain from voting on any particular artifact.
Arbiters may choose to do this if, for example, they feel unqualified
to determine the malintent of a particular artifact.
5. As necessary, Arbiter voting privileges are automatically
delegated to additional Ambassadors (in order of volume) to
ensure quorum on all ground truth determinations.

p. 10

Version 15

6. As necessary, we expect participants to challenge Arbiters’
determinations as is done today: with a blog post or technical
paper describing the malintent or benign nature of an artifact that
an authority such as an Arbiter had miscateogrized: an external PRdriven feedback loop.
The PolySwarm team will iteratively develop the details concerning
Arbiter voting and incentive structures during development. We expect
early Arbiter feedback will be instrumental to this design.
Topics of research include, but are not limited to:
• Minimum Arbiter quorum percentage
• Arbiter deferral procedure (for when quorum cannot be achieved)
• Appropriate Fee reward structure
• Incentive for timely ground truth determination, e.g. only first X
Arbiters to vote receive reward
• Penalty for non-participation, e.g. Arbiters must vote on ground
truth for X% of artifacts in a time window, else their Arbiter status
is revoked
• (As necessary) additional deterrents against perverse incentives

The Instruments
PolySwarm exposes two core instruments to End Users
and Ambassadors10 that increase the efficacy of the threat
intelligence market:

OFFER

p. 11

Polyswarm Offers: Requests made directly to reputable Security Experts
for their malintent prediction. PolySwarm provides frictionless access to
thousands of such researchers, enabling traditional information sharing
agreements with non-traditional participants. This interaction happens
inside Raiden11-style Offer Channels (detailed later). Once Channels
are established, Offers provide millisecond-scale latency for artifact
investigation.
10 Hereafter, End Users and Ambassadors is shortened to
Ambassadors. End Users may act as their own Ambassador.
We expect some large enterprises to participate in this
manner.
11 http://raiden.network/
Version 15

BOUNTY

Polyswarm Bounties: A wild-west style “Wanted” poster with accompanying
Artifact contents (e.g., Wanted: This Artifact: Malicious or Benign? Reward:
1000 NCT). Security Experts make a name for themselves (build reputation)
by successfully competing for Bounties. No direct analog exists in today’s
market.
Offers are the closest analogue to today’s on-demand scanning
market and operate with millisecond latency.
Ambassadors issue Offers and Artifacts directly to chosen Security
Experts, optionally under a non-disclosure agreement. Each Expert
chooses whether to accept the Offer based on their confidence in
rendering an accurate Assertion for the provided Artifact. Experts
may choose to decline if they are not confident so as to avoid
adversely affecting their reputation. If the Expert accepts the Offer,
the Expert commits to providing a malintent Assertion in a timely
fashion. Token collection and awards for all instruments are managed
and executed entirely by distributed smart contracts.
Issuing an Offer requires a certain familiarity with Experts
best equipped to dissect the Artifact in question. To ease this
matchmaking, Experts advertise their specialties via listings in the
PolySwarm Worker Registry - PolySwarm’s analog to Ethereum dApp
Registries12 and build public reputation by successfully participating
in similar Bounties.
Bounties are cheaper than Offers and require no upfront familiarity
with specific Experts, but Bounties are not for everyone.
First, Bounties must be mined into an Ethereum block, which occurs
approximately every 15 seconds - by far the dominant time cost in
this arrangement. Second, when placing a Bounty, the Artifact must
be made public13. After all, wild-west “Wanted” posters wouldn’t be
of much help if they weren’t posted in a public place with all known
information. In a similar manner, Bounties represent a public, smart
(as in contract) commitment to reward providers of information
that leads to the quarantine or exoneration of Artifacts. Bounties
also form a critical component of the feedback loop that establishes
ground truth.

iterations. See Artifact Confidentiality.
Version 15

Rewarding Accuracy
In a departure from today’s market, the PolySwarm market offers precise
rewards based solely on the accuracy of threat intelligence, incentivizing
Experts to optimize exclusively for detection accuracy (minimal false
positives and false negatives), and enabling Ambassadors to extract maximal
value on behalf of their clients. PolySwarm defines accuracy as agreement
(or not) between Experts’ Assertions and Arbiter-defined ground truth.
This accuracy feedback loop is driven by PolySwarm Bounties.
Each Bounty rewards Experts who render an accurate Assertion
and penalizes Experts making an inaccurate Assertion – all whilst
avoiding the introduction of collusion incentives between Ambassadors
and Experts14. PolySwarm Offers provide a convenient means of
achieving traditional 1:1 business relationships, but do not factor
into this accuracy equation.

Ground truth is produced and consumed in the PolySwarm marketplace in
the following manner:
1. An Ambassador places a Bounty on an Artifact, submitting a Fee to
do so.
2. Various Experts render Assertions on this Artifact prior to the
Bounty’s Assertion deadline. Each Assertion is accompanied by an
Expert-chosen NCT amount (a “Bid”) that reflects the Expert’s
confidence in their Assertion. A Fee is assessed as a percentage of
this “Bid”. These Assertions are confidential up until the Assertion
deadline.
3. The Ambassador produces a Verdict, taking Experts’ Assertions
into account however they see fit and delivers this Verdict to their
client. The Ambassador is incentivized to make this Verdict public in
order to build their reputation and take advantage of a Fee discount
(detailed later).
4. At a later time (e.g., 7 days after the Artifact was placed on
Bounty), Arbiters are offered the opportunity to vote on whether
the Artifact is in fact malicious or benign. This later-determined
ground truth IS NOT A BLOCKER FOR RAPIDLY RETURNING ARTIFACT
VERDICTS. In other words, Ambassadors need not (and should not)
wait for ground truth determination before returning a result to their
customer.

p. 13

14 This includes potential collusion interest between Experts
and Arbiters who vote on their own Bounties. The PolySwarm
Fee structure is designed such that no single Arbiter could
sway ground truth sufficiently to cause a colluding Expert
to receive a Bounty greater than the Arbiter’s cost for
introducing doubt into the market.

Version 15

5. A quorum of Arbiters determines the ground truth status of the
Artifact. The details of this vote to ground truth conversion process
are yet to be determined. Possible arrangements are simple majority
vote or proportional majority vote (e.g., based on amount of market
participation). These specifics will be determined during prototype
development.
6. With ground truth established, the Bounty smart contract awards
NCT to Experts who rendered accurate Assertions. The amount of NCT
awarded is proportional to the Expert’s Bid amount relative to the
total pool of accurate Bids.
On the surface, it may seem that a classic prediction market would
fit well here: Experts render Assertions and, at a later date, these
Assertions are compared against ground truth, ultimately triggering
rewards and penalties based on their accuracy. The trouble for
PolySwarm is that classic prediction markets implicitly assume
a source of ground truth that is verifiable by all participants. A
prediction market that asks who will win an election or whether the
price of gold will exceed an amount by a certain day is easily settled
because all participants can verify these data points after the
prediction period has closed: Who won the election? Did gold exceed
the strike price?
Determining the malintent of a suspect Artifact demands expertise
that is not uniformly shared among PolySwarm participants. This
conundrum has analogues to prediction markets applied to medical
diagnoses15, where doctors bring varying degrees of expertise to
bear.
PolySwarm entrusts ground truth determination to Arbiters. In
today’s market, the role of the Arbiter is effectively filled by
traditional anti-virus companies. These companies “vote” (and
are held publicly accountable) on “ground truth” via services
like VirusTotal. In the PolySwarm market, the set of Arbiters is
determined solely by market participation, offering opportunity for
newer players to shake up the establishment.
In summary, we believe this process properly incentivizes Arbiters to
commit resources to conduct due diligence when determining ground
truth for the benefit of the market as a whole.
This concept of an elite group of ground truth “verifiers” has
applicability to other sectors. We anticipate that others will explore
the feasibility of using this mechanism in other token platforms that
demand specialized knowledge to arrive at ground truth.

Version 15

Fees
Fees are assessed for various transactions in the PolySwarm market and are
designed to achieve two goals:
1. Promote efficiency in the PolySwarm market by incentivizing
actions that incur minimal Ethereum gas cost. Fixed-rate Fees
are applied to PolySwarm transactions to discourage behavior
that would generate superfluous transactions (including spam
transactions) and therefore incur unnecessary gas cost across the
market. PolySwarm’s need to scale these Fees independently of
Ethereum gas cost is one of several reasons the creation of NCT is
essential to the existence of the PolySwarm market.
2. Reward active PolySwarm market participants in proportion to
their (honest) participation. Fees are awarded to participants
that are actively utilizing the PolySwarm ecosystem via the
introduction of Artifacts (Ambassadors placing Bounties) and the
determination of ground truth regarding the malintent of Artifacts
(Arbiters reaching quorum on ground truth).
During network development, the PolySwarm team will red team the
Fee structures presented above, iterating as necessary to best
encourage a healthy market.

Bounty Placement Fees Paid by Ambassadors
When an Ambassador lists a Bounty on the PolySwarm market, the
following Fees are rendered on the funds that are held in the smart
contract:
1. A fixed listing Fee. This fixed fee encourages the Ambassador to
group multiple Artifacts into a single Bounty, reducing strain on the
network and gas costs for all.
2. A Fee proportional to the Bounty amount. Bounties with a higher
initial Bounty amount will likely attract more Expert responses. This
proportional Fee is assessed to scale the Fee with Expert interest
(and network strain).

Bounty Assertions Fees Paid by Experts
When an Expert renders an Assertion against a Bounty, the following
Fees are rendered on the funds that are held in the smart contract:

p. 15

Version 15

1. A fixed Assertion Fee. This fixed Fee disincentivizes repeated
Assertions that may slow down the network.
2. A Fee proportional to the Bid amount.

Offer Channel Settlement: Ambassador Fees
Offers occur within Raiden-style Offer Channels, established directly
between Ambassadors and Experts. When an Ambassador and/or
Expert decide to settle their Offer Channel onto the blockchain, the
following Fee is assessed by the Channel smart contract:
1. A percentage of the net NCT transfered over the channel. This
Fee is assessed on the Ambassador-supplied tokens when the channel
is opened. When the channel is closed, these Fees are refunded to
the Ambassador in proportion to unused channel tokens.

Protocol Details
Here we detail Polyswarm Bounties, Offers, Assertions and
Verdicts. Bounties and Offers are collectively referred to as
Polyswarm Listings. A Polyswarm Statement is any of: Bounty,
Offer, Assertion or Verdict.

BOUNTY

When an Ambassador wishes to place a Bounty on the
market, the Ambassador registers a Statement via a call to the
PolySwarm Bounty smart contract.
The Bounty Statement contains the following items:
1. Listing GUID: A globally-unique identifier for the Listing.
2. The Ambassador’s Identity. This takes the form of a signature
on the Statement, verifiable by anyone in possession of the
Ambassador’s address (public keys are derived from addresses).
3. A Bounty Placement Fee. This Fee is a fixed amount + a percentage
of the Bounty Amount (described in “Fee” section above). A discount
is applied if the Ambassador later publicly commits to a Verdict.
4. The Bounty Amount. This amount is placed into the smart contract
alongside the Bounty Placement Fee and is awarded to Experts that
render accurate Assertions (or refunded if no Experts respond). This
amount is akin to a transaction fee in Ethereum or Bitcoin and is
useful to call attention to the Bounty.
5. Cryptographic hash of the Artifact. Configurable, but currently
SHA256. This uniquely identifies the Artifact.
6. The URI of the Artifact. Due to storage costs, Artifacts are
not stored on-chain. We anticipate a secondary market to arise
for outsourcing storage and delivery of Artifacts16 and that some
Ambassadors will choose to retain a copy of all swarmed Artifacts
for later competitive analysis.
7. Assertion Deadline: Deadline for Assertion. The Ambassador
may choose to shorten or lengthen analysis periods based on their
requirements for the particular Artifact. Artifacts that require a
more in-depth analysis likely require more time (and also likely a
higher Bounty amount to attract attention), whereas other Artifacts
may require a quick turnaround.
Once the Bounty is listed, Experts will determine whether the Artifact
fits their skillset and whether their expected reward warrants their
attention. This expected reward is a function of their confidence
interval regarding the malintent of the Artifact.

16 Commentary on this and other anticipated secondary
markets provided later.

Version 15

Experts that choose to participate place Bids on their Assertions that
represent their level of confidence (and risk tolerance). The Bounty
amount plus the sum total of all inaccurate Bids are awarded to
accurate Bids in proportion to their Bid amount relative to the total
accurate Bid amount.
Consider the following example (Fees are omitted here for
simplicity):
1. An Ambassador places a Bounty with 2 NCT. This 2 NCT is placed
into the Bounty smart contract. Thus far, this 2 NCT Bounty Amount
constitutes the entire “pot” of potential winnings for accurate
Experts.
2. Experts A and B study the Artifact and decide to Assert that the
Bounty Artifact is benign. They place a 5 and 3 NCT bid on their
Assertions, respectively.
3. Experts C and D study the Artifact and decide to Assert that the
Bounty Artifact is malicious. They place a 1 and 4 NCT bid on their
Assertions, respectively.
4. At some later time, the Arbiters establish ground truth and
determine that the artifact was in fact malicious. Experts A and B
therefore rendered inaccurate Assertions; Experts C and D rendered
accurate Assertions.
5. The Bounty amount plus the Bids placed by Experts A and B make up
the “pot” that is proportionally awarded to Experts C and D. This
pot is 2 + 5 + 3 = 10 NCT.
6. Expert C made an accurate Assertion and her Bid represented 1/5 of
the total accurate Bid amount. Expert C has her Bid returned plus
her portion of the pot: 1 + 1/5 * 10 = 3 NCT.
7. Expert D made an accurate Assertion and his Bid represented 4/5 of
the total Bid amount. Expert D gets his bid back plus his portion of
the pot: 4 + 4/5 * 10 = 12 NCT.

Bounty Assertions contain:
1. Listing GUID + Cryptographic Hash: A unique reference to the
prompting Bounty Listing.
2. The Expert’s Identity: Again, as a signature on the Statement.
3. An Assertion Fee: This Fee is a fixed amount + a percentage of the
Bid amount (see “Fees” section).

p. 18

Version 15

4. Bid Amount.
5. The Assertion: A boolean “Malicious” or “Benign” determination
regarding the malintent of the Artifact. Assertions are kept secret
until the Bounty’s Assertion deadline expires. We anticipate using
blind commitments + a reveal phase to achieve this property.
6. (Optional) Metadata: Information derived during Assertion
generation and offered as a value-add to the Ambassador to utilize
in their Verdict computation (e.g., malware family). Experts may
volunteer this information as a means to differentiate themselves
and attract future business.
With Assertions streaming in, the Ambassador weighs Assertions and
incorporates their own internal due diligence efforts, producing a
“malicious” or “benign” Verdict. The Ambassador delivers this Verdict
to their client as their ultimate response regarding the malintent of the
Artifact. The Ambassador may also choose to make this Verdict public
(and is incentivized to do so via a Fee discount) before the Verdict
deadline.

Public Verdicts contains the following items:
1. Listing GUID: A reference to the prompting Listing.
2. The Ambassador’s NCT Identity: Again, as a signature on the
Statement.
3. The Verdict: A boolean “malicious” or “benign” determination
regarding the malintent of the Artifact.
At some later time, the Arbiters reach quorum on the ground truth
regarding the Artifact. This ground truth is compared against each
Experts’ Assertions and NCT is awarded for accurate Assertions.

p. 19

Version 15

Offer Lifecycle
OFFER

When an Ambassador wishes to issue Offers to a chosen Expert,
the Ambassador opens a Raiden-style channel with the Expert.
This is done by instantiating an Offer Channel smart contract with the Expert
that includes the following:
1. Identities of Ambassador and Expert.
2. Channel Balance: The maximum net NCT that the Ambassador is
comfortable settling with the Expert at channel close time (plus
Fees).

With the Offer Channel established, the Ambassador issues zero or more
Offers to the Expert. Each Offer includes the following:
1. Listing GUID: A globally-unique identifier for the Listing.
2. The Offer Amount. This Amount must not exceed the remaining
balance on the Offer Channel smart contract (minus Fees).
3. Cryptographic hash of the Artifact.
4. The URI of the Artifact. The Artifact is optionally encrypted
to the Offeree’s identity or otherwise access protected to ensure
confidentiality.
5. Engagement Deadline: Deadline for Engagement Response (described
below).
6. Assertion Deadline: Deadline for Assertion on this Offer.
When presented with an Offer, the Expert (Offeree) may choose to
engage with the Offer or ignore it. Each Offeree determines whether
this Artifact is worth evaluating for the Offered amount in the time
allotted.
The Offeree’s future business is based on their ability to produce
accurate results. If the Offeree is not confident in her ability to
produce an accurate result in the time allotted (e.g., the Artifact
is a filetype that the Offeree is ill-equipped to analyze), she may
choose to reject the Offer.

p. 20

Version 15

If the Offeree decides to reject the Offer, she either actively
issues a “decline” Engagement Statement or simply waits for the
Engagement Deadline to expire. It likely behooves the Offeree to
actively reject, rather than wait for the Engagement Deadline, as
Ambassadors will likely favor Experts who do not force them to wait
until the Engagement Deadline to determine next steps.
If the Offeree accepts the Offer, she issues an “accept” Engagement
Statement prior to the Engagement deadline.

Engagement Statements contain the following items:
1. Listing GUID + Hash: A reference to the prompting Listing.
2. Engagement Commitment: A boolean “accept” or “decline” that
states whether the Offeree will engage with this Offer and commit
an Assertion prior to the Offer’s Assertion Deadline.
Once the Offeree accepts an Offer, the Offeree has until the
Assertion Deadline to render an Assertion against the Offer.

These Assertions contain the following:
1. Listing GUID + Hash: Unique reference to the prompting Listing.
2. The Assertion: A boolean “malicious” or “benign” determination
regarding the malintent of the Artifact.
3. (Optional) Metadata: Information derived during Assertion
generation and offered as a value-add to the Ambassador to utilize
in their Verdict computation (e.g., malware family). Experts may
volunteer this information as a means to differentiate themselves
and attract future engagements.
After the Expert delivers her Assertion to the Ambassador, the
Ambassador signs a Raiden-style message that commits to also
deliver the Offer amount, so at no time is the Expert risking more
than the output of a single analysis. The sum of all such delivered
amounts are settled to the blockchain when the Offer Channel is
closed.
Unlike Bounties, Offers do not incorporate an on-chain ground truth
feedback mechanism. Instead, Offerees who either fail to render
an Assertion before the deadline or render an inaccurate Assertion
(as determined by later off-chain analyses) may not attract future
engagements. Reputation maintenance therefore becomes akin to an
off-chain feedback loop that uses market pressure to keep Offerees
honest.

p. 21

Version 15

When an Offer Channel is closed, a Fee is collected on the net NCT
transfered. As with all Fees, this Fee is awarded to active market
participants. The Fee is enforced by the master Offer Channel smart
contract which refuses to establish non-conforming Offer Channels.

Reputation
In contrast with other token platforms (e.g., Augur), PolySwarm does not
attempt to formalize the notion of reputation and build it into market
transactions.
The reason for this is simple: it is incredibly difficult to anticipate
which data points various participants value - and how these data
points are weighed. The best fit for Ambassador A may not be
the best fit for Ambassador B and it would be futile to try to get
them to both operate under the assumption that it was. Instead,
PolySwarm mechanics simply mandate or incentivize disclosure of the
kinds of data that likely represents useful input into a reputation
function.
Reputation algorithms will likely be regarded as a trade secret in
the same manner as Assertion to Verdict distillation algorithms.
Ambassadors will differentiate themselves by engaging with optimal
Experts for their Artifact workload. Experts will differentiate
themselves by maintaining a favorable track record of correct
Assertions when compared against ground truth. And, optionally, by
providing metadata, for example, the malware family they believe a
particular artifact belongs to.
The prototype Ambassador implementation to be developed will distill
various data points into a simple reputation “score” and an easyto-understand color scheme. This reference distillation will likely be
helpful to many, but may be replaced or modified as participants see
fit. Experts will likely also want to implement a reputation system
for evaluating Ambassadors, but the business logic of such a system
are expected to be more complex and differ more substantially among
participants.
The reference PolySwarm daemon will “decay” old data, maintaining
a “sliding window” into participants’ reputation. We believe a
sliding window approach is necessary to avoid lockout of new market
participants.
We anticipate making use of the following data points in a reference
Ambassador implementation:

p. 22

Version 15

1. Assertion accuracy (relative to ground truth and/or off-chain
analyses).
2. Frequency and average response times for both Bounties and
Offers. In the case of Offers, Ambassadors may choose to publish
aggregate data that is normally only observable within an Offer
Channel. Ambassadors may favor Experts who demonstrate rapid and
consistent response times.
3. Ability to maintain confidentiality of Artifacts delivered under
Offers. This is likely a hybrid on-market, off-market analysis.
Ambassadors may choose to review their competitors’ past Verdicts
and attempt to uncover errors (e.g., Ambassador A stated that
the sample was benign when in fact it was malicious). Experts may
seek to avoid doing business with Ambassadors whose due diligence
fails to hold up to such scrutiny in general or is more frequently
incorrect under specific circumstances (e.g. Ambassador A frequently
miscategorizes Microsoft Word documents resulting in certain Experts
avoiding analyzing Word documents on behalf of Ambassador A).
In other words, among other inputs, Experts may be interested in
Ambassadors’ Verdict accuracy.
Consumers will likely rely on aggregate Consumer Reports or AV
Comparatives-style websites and publications that report on each
Ambassador’s track record, perhaps with sample inputs with known
malintent and verification that an Ambassador’s Verdicts always
match what it represents back to its clients.

Worker Registry
Experts in the PolySwarm ecosystem will, in many cases, choose to
encapsulate their expertise into automated Workers. Workers are systems
that automatically respond to Bounties and Offers, perhaps with expertise for
certain filetypes or network traffic. The PolySwarm marketplace will provide
a distributed Worker Registry to ease discovery of Experts’ offerings.
We will develop a common interface and description language
for publicly registering Workers. These components will interact
with a PolySwarm Registry that is modeled after initial Ethereum
dApp registry smart contracts. PolySwarm’s Worker Registry will
contain descriptions that advertise particular skillsets (e.g., “I’m
good with Mac OS Mach-O binaries” or “I handle Microsoft Word
Documents”).

p. 23

Version 15

Artifact Confidentiality
Confidential disclosure of Artifacts is a first class feature in the PolySwarm
marketplace via the Offer instrument. Nevertheless, without taking additional
precautions, Ambassadors utilizing Offers must trust Security Experts’
motivations and technical ability to ward off attackers, possibly in perpetuity.
We expect this trust requirement to give rise to secondary markets
and novel applications of technology with the goal of minimizing
or consolidating trust. The following are several examples
of instruments built on top of PolySwarm to further address
confidentiality requirements.

Trust Minimization via Intel SGX
Intel SGX is a new technology initially shipped with the Skylake family
of processors. At a high level, SGX provides opaque computation
environments inside “enclaves”. Memory contents of SGX enclaves
are unavailable to other software and users on the same system,
irrespective of permission level. In the context of PolySwarm, SGX
enclaves would allow Experts to scan Artifacts without revealing
the Artifacts to the Researcher and without revealing the Experts’
intelligence to anyone else. SGX therefore promises mutual trust
reduction between Ambassadors and Experts.
Experts may choose to run accredited (and attested) SGX enclaves
that ingest the Artifact and their intelligence and produce an
Assertion that may be returned to the Ambassador. There are
technical hurdles to overcome, but we are confident SGX can be
integrated and scaled with enclaves bootstrapping one another in
a distributed fashion. Future iterations of PolySwarm may allow
Ambassadors to author future “SGX Bounty” statements into the
PolySwarm market, revealing the Artifacts only to bootstrapped
enclaves.

Trust Consolidation via Scan-as-a-Service (SaaS) Ambassadors
Experts may choose to outsource computation tasks to third parties
for a number of reasons that may or may not be PolySwarm-specific.
For example, we expect many Experts to make use of AWS, Google
Compute Engine, Azure or other such on-demand computational
services to scale their Assertion pipeline in response to PolySwarm
market demand. This is not an intrinsically PolySwarm-motivated
compute decision.

p. 24

Version 15

We expect PolySwarm-specific incentives for SaaS entities to arise
naturally. In the context of confidentiality, participants will create
SaaS companies that serve as trusted third parties sitting between
Ambassadors and Experts and maintaining nondisclosure agreements
with both. These SaaS companies would serve the same purpose as
SGX enclaves - protecting Artifacts from Experts and intelligence
details from Ambassadors.
Ambassadors may find it easier to trust third party SaaS entities with
public reputation rather than a large number of individual Experts whose
identity may not be known. Such Ambassadors will author more Offers
targeted at SaaS entities rather than directly at Experts.

Additional Markets
The PolySwarm market will create demand for a number of
additional markets. One such market (Scan-as-a-Service)
was previously discussed in the context enabling additional
confidentiality controls. Below are some additional expected
markets.
Ambassadors
This is an obvious market and one heavily discussed throughout this
document. Many Consumers will choose to do business with the market
through an Ambassador, but working through an Ambassador is not a
strict requirement.

Artifact Publishing Services
When placing a Bounty or Offer, the Ambassador must make their
Artifact available to Experts. Artifact hosting entities will offer
this service, making such sharing seamless. Their clients will be
Consumers and Ambassadors. We expect many Ambassadors to also
offer Artifact Publishing services.

Reputation Tracking Services
In the United States, three credit bureaus are trusted by banks to
maintain a ledger of “facts” regarding individual trustworthiness. The
PolySwarm market will present a similar demand; market participants
will want to quantify the trustworthiness of other participants for
a variety of reasons already discussed. It is likely that reputation
services will arise that track trustworthiness of participants and offer
this information to mitigate counterparty risk.

Version 15

Roadmap
Here we present preliminary PolySwarm development milestones. Each
milestone will: (1) offer new functionality and (2) provide documentation and
tests that enable new Ambassador, Expert, and End User transactions.
PolySwarm is at a distinct developmental advantage relative to
networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum that must retain all transactions
in perpetuity. Once ground truth is determined or an Offer Channel
is settled to the chain, Ambassadors and Experts have received what
they need out of that transaction: intelligence regarding the Artifact
and NCT, respectively. This atomicity provides leeway and allows us
to make backwards-incompatible changes, up until the 1.0 release,
without cost and consensus challenges experienced in other networks.

V0.1 Alpha (30 April 2018)
PolySwarm Alpha will focus on delivering a prototype end-to-end
workflow for Bounties after successful token sale. This initial
release will allow the PolySwarm team to begin the bootstrapping
process in earnest. Ambassadors and Experts will be able to transact
via a PolySwarm test network (“testnet”). The basic Bounty smart
contracts will be available on the PolySwarm testnet, allowing
Ambassadors to place Bounties, Experts to render Assertions, and
Ambassadors to render Verdicts.
We anticipate that PolySwarm Alpha will accomplish the following:

• A “Bounty Manager” smart contract which holds Bounty Amounts and
Fees, accepts Assertions, publishes Verdicts, and rewards accurate
Experts
• Artifact posting and retrieval to / from off-PolySwarm storage
(e.g. S3 and/or IPFS)
• Prototype algorithm for selecting Arbiters at Bounty expiration

• Reference implementations for Bounty publishing, Assertion response,
and Arbiter ground truth determination

V0.2 Beta (31 May 2018)

p. 26

PolySwarm Beta will focus on delivering PolySwarm Offer support over
Raiden-style Channels. Offers are designed to facilitate higherthroughput Artifact evaluation relative to Bounties and as such
demand more efficient blockchain settlement for each transaction.
PolySwarm Beta will implement Offer smart contracts. We anticipate
implementing this functionality as direct, peer to peer, Raiden-style
Channels established between Ambassadors and Experts which utilize
the testnet.
Version 15

We anticipate PolySwarm Beta will accomplish the following:
• Offer Channels

• Distributed Channel establishment

• multiple Offers via a single Channel
• NCT settlement at Channel Close

• Reference implementation for Offer production and response

• Reference implementation for Arbiter ground truth notification and
response
• Fee collection and distribution smart contracts

• Research and quantify trust (in NCT) required for a specific Artifact
volume
• Offer/Bounty development toolkit: a test and implementation
framework for Experts and Ambassadors to automate servicing of
Bounties and Offers

V0.3 Gamma (31 July 2018)
PolySwarm Gamma will focus on providing matchmaking features that
facilitate collaboration between Ambassadors, Experts, and Arbiters.
Experts will be able to encapsulate their expertise into Workers tuned
to specific types of Artifact. We expect them to be able to advertise
these Workers in a PolySwarm Registry. This Worker Registry should
allow Ambassadors to engage with Workers in a risk-free manner
prior to the Stable release (Gamma will continue to utilize the
PolySwarm testnet).
Additionally, this release will consider enhancing and extending the
Bounty instrument in light of Alpha and Beta feedback and experience.
As one example, we anticipate that Bounties will benefit from the
ability to solicit Assertions that are kept confidential from other
Experts and revealed only after the Assertion deadline.
We anticipate PolySwarm Gamma will accomplish the following:

• Worker Description Language (WDL) describing artifact analysis
capabilities and Expert authorship attribution (for reputation)

• Distributed, searchable, registry of Workers and their capabilities.
• Confidentiality for pre-deadline Bounty Assertions

• Finalize Arbiter selection, response, and end to end Bounty feedback
loop
We anticipate that Gamma will be feature complete.

p. 27

Version 15

Polyswarm 1.0 (Q4 2018)
PolySwarm Stable will focus on eliminating bugs in PolySwarm Gamma
prior to migration from the PolySwarm testnet (test tokens) to the
real PolySwarm market.
As a stretch goal and as time / funding allows, Stable may introduce
first-class Artifact confidentiality via a limited-audience Bounty.

Polyswarm 2.0 (Q2 2019)
PolySwarm’s second stable release currently has two main goals:
expanding Offers and Bounties to handle a wider range of Artifact
types (e.g. URLs and Network streams) and easing PolySwarm
utilization for the Enterprise and Home User.
Artifact type expansion in future PolySwarm releases should make
it possible to handle, for example, automated phishing attempt
detection of end user URLs by placing Bounties and Offers directly on
hosted content.
Extending PolySwarm’s protections directly to the endpoint will be
a priority for post-Stable development. We anticipate developing
an Open Source reference implementation of an Endpoint protection
suite which automatically blocks malicious artifacts based on
PolySwarm’s intelligence. We see this open agent framework as a key
to widespread end user adoption.

Future Features
PolySwarm’s future releases will mirror the evolving threat landscape
and real-world usage of the network. We see several opportunities,
contingent on observed PolySwarm usage, for the following features
to benefit the network and the ultimate goal of end user protection:
• Flexible Artifact confidentiality
• Basic: Artifacts selectively disclosed to Experts or SaaS providers
• Advanced: Artifacts never revealed to anyone outside of SGX
enclaves of fully homomorphic engines
• New Instruments (e.g. subscription-ready threat feeds)
• Deployment support for endpoint-resident Worker containers that
supplant today’s endpoint protection suites.

Version 15

Token Sale
Technical development, community engagement and participant outreach
for the PolySwarm ecosystem will be conducted by PolySwarm Pte. Ltd. with
funding derived from the sale of PolySwarm's Nectar utility tokens (NCT).
These tokens will be exchanged by participants for threat
intelligence. NCT powers all the major PolySwarm interactions:
Bounty placement, Offer channel establishment / teardown /
exchange, assertion registration and ground truth determination. By
selling utility-specific NCT tokens, exchange rates for NCT to threat
intelligence should enjoy isolation from the volatility in the larger
ETH market, ensuring active participation in PolySwarm without
concern for fluctuations in ETH.
This section is intended to give a high level overview of PolySwarm’s
tokenomics. Should any conflict between this document and the Token
Sale Agreement (“Agreement”) arise, the Agreement shall take
precedence. The Token Sale Agreement is available online.

Schedule
PolySwarm Pte. Ltd., Inc is currently operating a token PreSale for
invited participants. The public NCT sale is scheduled to open to
qualified buyers on February 20, 2018 at 19:00 UTC. It is scheduled
to close March 22, 2018 at 19:00 UTC.

Purchase Requirements
NCT will be made available exclusively for purchase with Ether (ETH).
Potential buyers are advised to secure sufficient ETH in advance of
the sale.
The token sale will employ Know Your Customer (KYC) controls with
a unique technical mechanism to tie specific purchases to KYC
data points including, but not limited to: Country of Origin, email
address, full name, IP address and acceptance of the terms in the
Token Sale Agreement.

p. 29

Version 15

Caps / Limits
No new tokens will be created after the close of the token sale
period.
The total number of NCT tokens will be determined during the token
sale.
The maximum number of tokens is capped. This cap is based on the
maximum funding USD cap, the price of NCT (in ETH) and the current
ETH to USD exchange rate. Refer to the token sale web page for
specifics on NCT caps, price, funding tranches and more.

Allocation
70% of NCT tokens will be sold during the Token Sale.
15% of the remaining 30% will be distributed to enterprises, vendors
and Security Experts interested in helping bootstrap the PolySwarm
ecosystem. Recipients will be chosen at PolySwarm Pte. Ltd.. sole
discretion.
The final 15% of tokens will be used by PolySwarm Pte. Ltd. in a
manner that best accelerates adoption of the PolySwarm ecosystem.
As an illustrative example, tokens may be offered as incentive to
participate in PolySwarm “hackathons”. This allocation will be at
PolySwarm Pte. Ltd.. sole discretion.

p. 30

Version 15

Distribution
We envision that ETH derived from the sale of PolySwarm's Nectar
utility tokens (“NCT”) will be allocated in the following manner:
Legal
14.49%

Marketing
13.62%

Protocol &
Software Development

Tax
10.32%

54.51%

Office Expenses
3%

Operational Overhead

54.51% - Protocol and Software Development
3.00% - Office Expenses
4.06% - Operational Overhead (travel, hosting, etc)
14.49% - Legal
13.62% - Marketing
10.32% - Tax

The PolySwarm team expects Legal spending to decrease in FY19/20.
The surplus will be redistributed into Marketing, Overhead and
Developer Salaries.
Our 10.32% estimated Tax is low, but not unreasonable. This is
good for participants: more funding will be allocated directly to the
development and promotion of PolySwarm.

p. 31

Version 15

Disclaimer
This whitepaper is intended to provide technical background
to would-be token purchasers. The PolySwarm token sale will
fund initial prototype development and testing of the economic
instruments presented here. We expect, as would any prudent
participant, that the details presented in this document may
change during pre-Stable development and testing periods.
PolySwarm Pte. Ltd. and token purchasers’ interests are
aligned to make PolySwarm a viable marketplace that truly
disrupts the threat intelligence industry.

Conclusion
PolySwarm is a novel market and associated ERC20 token,
NCT, that is posed to disrupt the threat intelligence industry
by facilitating new methods of interaction between security
experts, vendors and enterprises. The PolySwarm team will be
conducting a token launch to fund software development and
to cultivate a community around this new marketplace.
We hope you’ll join us in protecting users from All Angles™.
