Abstract
In this paper we describe ARTH value coin, the world’s first non-depreciating currency: a
decentralized algorithmic cryptocurrency designed to maintain its purchasing power over time,
irrespective of which direction the market moves.

A brief about Inflation and Stablecoins
You don’t need to dive too deep into the evolution of society to pick up on the fact that greater
centralization of power has been the trade-off for advancing forms of organisation. While
centralization has its merits, it has always, in one form or another, come with one integral
requirement; trust. To participate, you must place trust in the the authority at the centre. A gradual
erosion of trust in such centralized structures has given rise to the phenomenon of
decentralization.

The Loss of Purchasing Power
Whilst there have been efforts to decentralize aspects of decision making in the past, nothing has
been as profound as the decentralizing of money. During an important period in our history, gold
was the de-facto global reserve and the underlying asset that gave us trust in sovereign currency
or paper money. The 1971 US government under President Richard Nixon “unpegged” the US
Dollar from gold, effectively bringing the gold standard to an end. Various political and economic
events before and after that pivotal decision left the US Dollar the new global reserve currency,
albeit backed by nothing but trust.
The Federal Reserve, freed from the constraints of pegging their “paper” to gold, has been
constantly expanding the money supply since under various pretexts. However, it is an
indisputable fact that virtually all fiat currencies, including the dollar, have lost anywhere between
50-100% of their value over the last few decades. Little is spoken of enduring inflation and
permanent loss of “purchasing power” becoming a mainstay in our modern economic system.

Decentralizing Money and Beyond
We cannot mention decentralized money without pointing to the pioneering success of Bitcoin,
which made it possible to transfer value without a centralized authority through intricately designed,
immutable infrastructure. Ethereum, by way of a programmable and smart contract based system,
has catalysed blockchain adoption to open up the possibility of absolute decentralization, seen in
various forms of apps, platforms, and most notably; entire organizations.
It’s in this element of decentralization of organizations that MakerDAO homes in on, implementing
the concept of a two-token infrastructure, namely the Maker Token and DAI. This project showed
that it was possible to create decentralized stablecoins that are algorithmic and backed by crypto
collaterals.

The Solution
In the context of chronic declines in purchasing power and the decentralisation of money, the
ARTH ecosystem builds upon MakerDAO’s concept of DAI to pioneer new mechanisms, resulting
in a coin that’s both value-stable and a raw measure of an asset’s buying power.
We hereby introduce ARTH, a decentralized algorithmic value-stable coin that aims to maintain,
and in some cases even appreciate, the buying power or value of the coin irrespective of which
direction the market moves.
ARTH is able to do this as it’s backed to stable collaterals, which are complete hedges of one
other, so that if one asset depreciates in buying power, the other in turn asset appreciates, keeping
the net buying power of the coin stable.
ARTH uses a special method of measuring an asset’s buying power that’s not tied to any fiat
currencies, which in turn makes ARTH inflation-proof.

Calculating the buying power of an asset
Most assets in the cryptocurrency space are denominated in US Dollars. However, as outlined in
the previous sections, USD itself has lost most of its purchasing power over the past few decades,
which causes issues for anybody who holds USD or has assets that are backed by USD, as they
will also have to account for inflation.
To create an asset that is designed to protect the buying power of its holder, we need to come up
with an absolute unit of measure to translate the buying power of an asset, which is not measured
in US dollars. A natural suggestion could be to calculate buying power in terms of how many units
of gold an asset can be traded for, as gold was once the standard measure of wealth.
Understanding how to measure the buying power of an asset is important, in order to make
accurate decisions based on whether or not the asset’s absolute buying power has appreciated or
depreciated.

Global measurement unit
One of the features that will differentiate ARTH coin from the other stable coins and MahaDAO
from the other DAOs is our Global measurement unit (GMU). Designed uniquely and precisely to
fulfil MahaDAO vision, creating timeless value currency – ARTH coin.
The global measurement unit is responsible for keeping ARTH coin resistant to depreciation.
In other words, GMU represents a basket of assets carefully selected with adequate weights to
present strong hedge strategy against all economic turbulences and many risks regarding, especially
inflation and currency risk.
The basket consists of the key currencies and main global commodities like gold as it’s a typical
example of a safe haven. What stands behind the decision to peg GMU with several prominent
currencies is the fact that these sovereign currencies have a sound and stable macroeconomic
position, superb AAA credit rating and significant share in world GDP. Given this fact, we can observe
their Treasury bond rates and compare them to inflation which will help us deciding which currency
holds real value.
Compared to the International Monetary Fund’s SDR, which only consists of main currencies and is
not protected against political influence, the GMU will also include small portion of riskier assets in
form of Bitcoin and will be undoubtedly immune to political influence. Bitcoin is the right choice for a
riskier asset because its price basically represents spillovers from world stock exchanges. Another
advantage of GMU is that the initial basket of currencies can be changed, both the shares of the
assets and the assets themselves can be replaced in order to adapt to the given economic
circumstances, providing stability that ARTH coin stands for from a dynamic viewpoint.

The ARTH Vault
The vault was a concept first introduced in MakerDAO as a way of managing the underlying
collaterals that have been locked to generate a token.
The ARTH vault builds further on this, borrowing concepts like the DSR (DAI Savings Rate),
emergency shutdown, stability fees, amongst others, to create a system that behaves similar to
what would be the equivalent of a decentralized reserve bank.

Page 3 of 14

The ARTH vault generates ARTH tokens by locking in collaterals and minting new ARTH tokens
against them in the form of debt; and releases collaterals when this debt is paid back, thereby
burning the ARTH tokens.
The vault will facilitate the buying and selling of underlying collaterals in various market scenarios
to maintain the net buying power of the ARTH coin.
Essentially the main purpose of the ARTH vault is two-fold:
1. Ensure that the buying power of the minted ARTH tokens never go below a certain point.
2. Employ strategies to enable the vault to increase the net buying power by locking in greater
collaterals as the market fluctuates.

Creating ARTH tokens using the ARTH Vault
To create ARTH, a vault needs to be created and collateral needs to be deposited and locked
inside of it. Against that value of the locked collaterals, ARTH tokens are minted and given to the
vault owner as debt.
To release the collaterals locked in the vault, the vault owner pays back his debt along with a
stability fee, which can be paid in ARTH or in MAHA tokens. When the debt is paid off, the ARTH
tokens are burnt and removed from the supply.

Debt-to-Collateral ratio
The debt-to-collateral ratio will ensure that ARTH tokens are always issued at a value less than the
net value of the vault. This gives some contingency to price volatility for any of the collaterals
before a vault stands a chance of being liquidated.
For example, a collateral with a 150% debt-to-collateralization ratio will allow for 50% of the
collateral’s value to be issued in the form of ARTH tokens.

Vault Liquidation & Liquidation Ratio
A vault risks liquidation when the collaterals that have been locked in depreciate in value and the
position held by the vault nears the liquidation ratio.
When a vault is marked as to be liquidated, the ARTH minting stops and the locked collaterals are
sold to any buyer willing to pay back the debt in ARTH, at a discount to the vault owner.
These liquidation ratios mean that despite potential price swings, the ARTH market itself as a
whole is never undercollateralized. This also ensures value stability for the ARTH coin.

Collateral Buying Power Ratio
The buying power ratio of each of the collaterals deposited in the vault is a predefined value, used
to define exactly how much of each collateral should be in the vault.
For example, a vault designed with two assets A and B, and with a collateral buying power ratio of
1:1, should result in the buying power of both assets remaining the same, at all times.
Any deviation from this ratio will force the vault to perform a rebalancing, where it will sell one
collateral for the other, bringing the balance back to the ratio.

Rebalancing the underlying collaterals
Since the ARTH vault is backed by collaterals, it will eventually be subject to market fluctuations.
Hence, the net buying power of the vault can either appreciate or depreciate due to market effects
on the underlying collaterals.
In cases where the net buying power of the vault depreciates, the vault does not do any
rebalancing to counter this depreciation. The depreciation of the vault is a weighted average of the
depreciation across all the collaterals.
In cases where the net buying power appreciates, the vault will perform a rebalance to try and
maintain the buying power ratios.
Which means just like a reserve bank, the ARTH vault will systematically buy or sell the underlying
collaterals for one another, so that all of the collateral’s buying power ratios are met.

Rules for Rebalancing
The strategy employed for rebalancing by the vault will follow the following rules:
1. That the buying power of all collaterals maintain the ratio defined at all times.
2. The collateral being sold is the asset which has appreciated in buying power and the
amount to be sold is calculated based on the increase in buying power.
3. The collateral being bought is the asset which has depreciated in buying power and the
amount to be bought is calculated based on the amount of other collaterals we can sell.
4. The collaterals are sold in such a way that we are not left with less than 50% of the quantity
we started off with. This is known as a stop-sell.

Understanding the Stop-sell
Because we are selling an appreciating asset for a depreciating one, we end up in a scenario
where if one side continues to appreciate, the vault strategy will continue selling off the
appreciating collateral to maintain the buying power ratio.
This causes a situation where the vault will end up having sold one side of the collateral fully and
end up having a full exposure to the other collateral.

Page 5 of 14

The stop-sell ensures that the vault will never sell collateral more than a percentage of what it had
initially started with.
For example, if the vault had a stop sell of 10% and one of the collaterals, say, asset A appreciates
by 50%. Then this will trigger the vault to trigger a rebalance and make a trade selling 16% of asset
A. But since selling 16% is more than our stop sell of 10%, this trade does not execute.

Rebalancing Strategy Example
To elaborate how the rebalancing strategy works in a real-world scenario where one asset
appreciates, we have drawn up a visualisation. In this example, we have two assets, namely A and
B, and a vault which maintains a 50-50 ratio with respect to the buying power of each asset. The
following diagram demonstrates how the vault will behave in this scenario.

A vault with two assets holding a 50-50 ratio between them in buying power. Asset A is worth 1 unit of buying power and
Asset B is worth 0.5 units of buying power. Creating a vault with a net buying power of 1000 units.

Page 6 of 14

Now assuming that the buying power for Asset A appreciates by 50% and that it remains the same
for Asset B, we end up with the following composition in our vault.

Status of the vault when asset A appreciates by 50%. Net buying power of the vault is 1250 units

When asset A appreciates by 50% in buying power, the quantities held by the vault of both assets
remain the same. However, the net buying power of the vault has now become 1250 units which is
an increase of over 25%.
When this happens, the vault triggers a rebalance by selling the excess appreciated amount of
asset A for asset B. Since asset A appreciated by 250 buying power units (500 - 750), the vault
decides to sell off half of that, 125 buying power units of A, for asset B; to come back to the 50-50
buying power ratio.
Which means a trade is published selling 125 buying-power units of A for 125 buying-power units
of B.
After taking into account the price of A and B, we come up with the final trade which is selling X
units of A for Y units of B.

The vault after it has rebalanced and sold asset A for asset B

After the rebalance the vault is back to a 50-50 ratio in buying power, but the quantities of both A
and B have changed.
Moreover, if asset A keeps on further appreciating, then the vault will continue to sell more of asset
A to buy more of asset B; but the vault will stop selling asset A if it has already sold more than 50%
of what it had initially started off with.
This is done to avoid selling off too much of asset A and to also allow the vault owner to realise the
continuous upside of having an appreciating asset.
All parameters for the strategy can be changed upon vote by the governance token holders.

Holding auctions to buy/sell the underlying
collateral
When the vault decides to buy/sell locked collaterals, it’ll automatically open a trade/swap, placing
the collateral to be sold on one side and requesting the collateral to be bought on the other side.
The rate for which the collaterals are sold are determined by two variables.
1. A price feed, which is given by price oracles.
2. A market maker discount.
The market maker discount is a reduction applied to the trade price to make the it more attractive
to market makers, who’ll fulfil the order to realise a profit through arbitrage in other markets.
Since the amount being sold is from the profits of vault, the vault can risk giving away a discount as
the change in net buying power still remains positive.
Initially, a market maker discount can be set to promote more engagements with market makers.
The auction parameters are community governed and can be changed upon vote by MAHA token
holders.

Choosing the right kind of collaterals for ARTH
An ARTH vault’s true value is derived from the value of the underlying assets inside of it. As a
result, it’s crucial to choose the right kind collaterals and their ratios when deciding the value of
ARTH.
The ARTH vaults are designed to appreciate in value when one of the underlying assets
appreciates in value and contributes to the net vault’s value as a whole. In certain scenarios when
all of the collaterals locked inside the ARTH vault depreciate, the ARTH vault would also
depreciate.
Hence, it’s important to choose collaterals that are perfect hedges of each other to come up with a
strategy that appreciates the value of ARTH regardless of the direction of the market.
Therefore, when choosing a collateral, the following points need to be considered:
•

High Market Capitalization: Collaterals with large enough market capitalization should be
preferred over smaller ones. Small market cap collaterals would not only limit the amount of
value that can be captured by the vault but would also be more liable to manipulation.
Choosing high market cap assets will ensure steady price-movements and avoid vaults
getting liquidated during major price swings.

•

Uncorrelated to other assets or negative beta: Ideally collaterals should be chosen such
that they have a negative beta with other collaterals. In other words, they are perfect
hedges of each other and when one collateral goes down, the other collateral should go up
to keep the value stable. Fiat collaterals are often heavily correlated with the US dollar.
Crypto collaterals are often heavily correlated with Bitcoin. The collateral ratios decide how
much of each collateral is stored within the vault and can be governed by MAHA token

Page 9 of 14

holders. This will allow MAHA token holders to easily introduce or phase out collaterals as
and when needed.
For example, a vault with three different collaterals with a buying power ratio of 1:1:1, will try to
maintain a reserve with equal buying power for each collateral as per the strategy mentioned
above.
In cases where one of the underlying collaterals becomes unstable or is deemed as “high” risk, it
can slowly and gradually be removed from the ARTH vault by reducing its buying power ratio to 0.
This can be a community governed decision made by MAHA token holders.

Simulating across various market scenarios
We use the following parameters:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Stop sell of 30%
Stop loss of 30%
5% slippage for every rebalance
Rebalance to happen once every 7 days
50% of the appreciated value from the appreciating asset, is sold off during every rebalance
Starting with a buying power of 100 (so that it is easy to measure % increase)

Using a basket of Forex, Gold and US Equities
Here we try with data from 1990-2020 and keep 50% of the vault’s buying power in GOLD and the
remaining in Australian Dollar, Euro and SPY500 ETF. AUS and EUR will represent the fiat
markets and SPY500 ETF will represent the stock market. Since usually gold is often used as a
hedge against the stock & forex markets, we keep a 50% ratio in gold.
Buying power for this simulation is calculated in USD. Assets chosen are distributed with the
following ratios:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Australian Dollar (20% starting buying power)
Gold (50% starting buying power)
S&P 500 ETF (10% starting buying power)
Euro (20% starting buying power)

At the end of the simulation, the vault has rebalanced itself around 90 times over the course of 20 years and has
appreciated itself by over 309%. (Full analysis and code can be found here)

Using a basket of Stablecoins, Gold and Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of this simulation is to understand how ARTH would perform in a real-world scenario,
as if it had launched around the year 2019. Here we choose a basket of stablecoins, gold and
cryptocurrencies keeping stablecoins on one side of the hedge and fiat currencies on the other
side.
Buying power for this simulation is calculated in USD. Assets chosen are distributed with the
following ratios:
1.
2.
3.
4.

WBTC (20% starting buying power)
Gold (10% starting buying power)
ETH (20% starting buying power)
Euro (50% starting buying power)

At the end of the simulation, the vault has rebalanced itself around 6 times over the course of 1 year and has appreciated
itself by over 80%. (Full analysis and code can be found here)

How to calculate the price of one ARTH token
Whilst we talk about ARTH in terms of it’s buying power, to the end user, ARTH will most likely be
represented in their native fiat currency (like USD, RNB, EUR etc..).
The value of ARTH in a particular currency can simply be thought of as the net value of all the
underlying collaterals backing 1 ARTH token denominated in that currency.
This would mean that if we were to calculate the USD value of one ARTH token, then it’d look
something like the following. (note that BTCUSD price at the time of writing is 10,500$)
(assuming two collaterals used: ie BTC and USD)

BTC
USD

value

value

= (supply of locked BTC) * (BTC/USD price ~ 10,500$)
= (supply of locked USD) * (USD/USD price ~ 1$)

ARTH

circulation

ARTH

USD

= total circulation of ARTH

= (BTC

value

+ USD

value

) / (ARTH

circulation

)

But this does not account for slippage or the various transaction fees that a user will have to
account for when moving collaterals back and forth the various sidechains for example.
Moreover, not every ARTH token is directly redeemable for the proportion of the underlying
collateral. The collaterals are only redeemable in two scenarios, either when the vault is nearing its
liquidation point or when the owner of the vault decides to sell the ARTH tokens and release the
collaterals.
For example; if every vault is created with a minimum of 100 ARTH tokens, it’ll be impossible to
redeem 1 ARTH token for its underlying value. A minimum of 99 ARTH tokens would be needed to
liquidate the vault and redeem its collaterals.
Finally, this equation also does not account for any overcollateralization because of the 50% stopsell which we have defined in the vault’s strategy.
Taking all of the above into consideration, we introduce three new variables to come to the true
market rate of an ARTH token: 1. Slippage
2. Overcollateralization
3. Fees
Any deviation from this market rate can easily be corrected by arbitrageurs and market makers.
ARTH

True USD value

= ARTH * Slippage - Fees + OverCollateralization
usd

As we can see it’s not very straightforward to calculate the value of one ARTH coin when you
compare it with a fiat.

Page 12 of 14

Huge fluctuations in ARTH’s price will only happen when the market cap of ARTH is small and the
markets are not liquid enough. Because ARTH is backed by its underlying assets, major price
fluctuations will be less frequent as markets and ARTH become more and more liquid.

Stability Fees
To control the supply of ARTH tokens in the market, the ARTH vault will charge a fee in MAHA
tokens to the vault liquidator whenever he/she wishes to release the locked collaterals in the vault.
A high fee will discourage creation and liquidation of ARTH vaults and a low fee will encourage
creation and liquidation of ARTH vaults.
Fees collected will be burnt off, reducing the supply of MAHA tokens and hence appreciating its
value.

Emergency shutdown
To protect the ARTH holders against attacks on the infrastructure, an emergency shutdown
module can be invoked as a last resort.
Upon activation, the emergency shutdown module will deploy a two-pronged safety mechanism in
which new vaults will stop getting created and all existing vaults will be instructed to stop creating
new ARTH tokens. This will enable vault owners to reclaim their collaterals against the circulating
ARTH and the overall rebalancing activities will come to a halt as well.
MAHA Minority can use this Emergency Shutdown Module to specifically thwart three types of
attacks:
1. Malicious governance
2. Critical bug in smart contract code
3. Long-term market irrationality
The MAHA voters will determine a quorum (initially 1,000,000 MAHA) that is required to be
deposited to trigger the Emergency Shutdown. Irrespective of a quorum being reached, all MAHA
Tokens deposited into this module will be immediately burnt off.

ARTH Savings Rate - ASR
An ARTH Savings Rate system has been put into place to allow token holders to earn passive
income whilst holding ARTH. The model incentivizes the balance of supply and demand of ARTH
and allows for capital to be deployed more efficiently while still holding true to its core role of
providing strong, decentralized stability.
The ASR is a basic interest system. Token holders can lock and unlock ARTH into a savings
contract which would continuously accrue interest based on ASR, a global system variable. If the
prevailing ASR is 3%, a holder who locks 100 ARTH tokens for a full year, will earn three additional
ARTH when they unlock the same. The funds needed for the ASR come from the stability fees paid
by CDP’s. For example, average stability fees of 4% collected on CDP’s could easily fund an ASR
of 3%.

Page 13 of 14

Beyond keeping the balance of demand and supply of ARTH, this system will prove to be a major
monetary policy lever that the decentralized governance can control. This will be a global
parameter that will be adjusted often to deal with short-term changes in the market conditions of
the ARTH economy.
These two mechanisms in conjunction, provide a powerful array of tools to guard both short-term
and long-term stability of the ARTH token.

Known Risks
The following risks have been identified as risks to the stability of ARTH.
•

New economic model - Any uncertainties with any new economic model

•

Smart contract bugs - Possibility of any bug in the smart contract can bring the entire
system down, no matter how much code-review has been done on the smart contracts.

•

Low liquidity - If there isn't enough liquidity to support the various rebalances or generate
enough ARTH, then ARTH can see itself depreciate in value.

•

Collapse of one of the underlying collaterals - An unstable collateral which collapses
can cause ARTH to lose its value proportionate to how much value exposure was there to
the collateral.

•

Collapse of the price feeds - The price feeds are a crucial piece for the ARTH vaults to
determine the situation of the market. Any collapse in these price feeds would cause the
ARTH vaults to make decisions based on incorrect data.

•

Centralization of MAHA tokens - Majority of the decisions made for ARTH are decided
upon MAHA token holders. Therefore a centralisation of MAHA tokens will cause the
decisions to be one-sided which might not possibly result in the best outcome.
