SmartMesh® : HyperMeshTM Ecosystem

1. Executive Summary
Our current Cyber-Physical Infrastructure is a technological marvel, gifting mankind with tools to
innovate at an ever-increasing exponential rate. We depend on such innovation if we are to
survive and thrive as a species.
However, the need for faster, ubiquitous, exchange of information and value continues to expand
in scope, even bringing in everyday objects and machines. The current infrastructure, which was
built by corporations focusing on maximizing share-holder profits, is flawed, due to the centralized
nature of the business model, and by the resulting centralized networks which have been created.
In March, 2018, the world-wide-web turned 29 years old. In an open letter to mark the 29th
anniversary of his invention, Berners-Lee made some sharp criticisms on how the technology has
been deployed:
In recent years, we’ve seen conspiracy theories trend on social media platforms, fake
Twitter and Facebook accounts stoke social tensions, external actors interfere in elections, and
criminals steal troves of personal data.
These problems have proliferated because of the concentration of power in the hands of a
few platforms – including Facebook, Google, and Twitter – which control which ideas and
opinions are seen and shared.
Furthermore, centralized data in the hands of a few corporations constitute single-points-offailure and are susceptible to a myriad of internet attacks such as DDOS, malware, etc.
While many in the developed countries enjoy advanced technology, there is a growing divide with
the rest of the world. There are currently 3.9 Billion people without internet access, 2 Billion
people who are unbanked, and 1.2 Billion without access to electricity [Paygo]. The current
system cannot effectively address such needs. A new paradigm is needed.
The next generation infrastructure will not be just another iteration on the previous architectures.
Rather, it will be a HyperMeshTM architecture, a distributed, synergized blend of networking,
computing, content distribution, financial technology, and cyber-physical infrastructures.
The HyperMeshTM Infrastructure is being built from the ground-up, in a distributed fault-tolerant
manner, incentivized by blockchain cryptocurrencies, powered by renewable transactive energy,
and enabled by a world-wide Satellite Internet with local peer-to-peer (P2P) Meshed
communication on the ground.

2. SmartMesh® and Meshbox® Introduction
Meshbox® Foundation has been partnering with SmartMesh® Foundation from the beginning to
realize the HyperMeshTM Infrastructure. SmartMesh® blockchain technology has been optimized
to run on MeshBox®es.
SmartMesh® has deployed the Spectrum public blockchain, which supports the following coins
and tokens.
 SmartMesh® Token coin, listed on Huobi.pro and Gate.io, and used for Spectrum
blockchain.
 MESH tokens, listed on FCoin.com and HitBTC, and used for the Content Delivery
Networks, supporting video streaming.
Meshbox® and SmartMesh® bring about a paradigm shift to enable Infrastructure deployment
which is highly robust, yet flexible, due to the ability to operate
 With or without the Internet (or Intermittent Internet)
 With or without a blockchain; with Photon high-throughput Payment Network,
 With or without an electrical grid; with renewable battery and solar technology.
MeshBox®es are used to form large, highly-scalable Wifi Mesh Networks spanning both indoors,
and outdoors, over which SmartMesh®’s blockchain technology is layered.

3. HyperMeshTM versus Traditional Communications
MeshBox®es are used to build a HyperMesh TMed Infrastructure, which incorporates a newly
emerging networking paradigm.
In First-generation Circuit-Switching, each connection between communicating parties receives
dedicated (reserved) Bandwidth, even when not being used. Examples include Plain-OldTelephone System (POTS), SONET/SDH, and DWDM for fiber communications.
Second-generation Packet Switching is comprised of storing-and-forwarding of message-segments
(packets) in routers, which dynamically arbitrate/schedule which packets are transmitted on
shared transmission lines. This sharing provides better resource sharing of shared resources and
makes use of buffers (memory) to temporarily store packets, thus greatly improving the utilization
and efficiency of networking resources. Examples are Switched Ethernet, Internet Routers, and
Voice-over-IP.
The newly emerging Third-generation is called Token-SwitchingTM and is enabled by Blockchain.
In this new paradigm the scope is greatly expanded from information exchange to a selfsustainable Internet of Value (IoV), represented by the exchange of tokens. Tokens can represent
not only monetary value (e.g. Ethers, SMT, MESH), but also non-monetary entities such as a car or
house title, personal identity, medical records, a vote in an election, and can even be linked to
physical objects in a supply chain.
The following shows the progression of networking and computer architecture from the
mainframe era to today’s HyperMeshTM infrastructure, which supports the Internet of Value.

3.1

HyperMeshTM Infrastructure and 5G Cellular Interworking

In a traditional networks with 4G cellular communications, all traffic goes to Data Center
Cloud Servers for Economy-of-Scale of compute and storage resources. However, this
requires many hops (at least 13) between terminals, even those which are physically close
to each other, and thus suffers from high energy and latency requirements. In Cellular
5G’s Cloud RAN architecture, traffic from Wifi networks only needs to go to the Cloud
RAN, which is located close to Base-Stations. Value-add for Over-the-Top applications
are moved to the Cloud RAN in an effort to support Edge-Intelligence. This results in
fewer hops, (at least 8), but is still expensive. In both 4G and 5G scenarios, while Wifi is
an essential part of the architecture, a Wifi Mesh is not desirable since such mesh traffic
cannot be seen, and thus cannot be monetized or analyzed for value-add to Over-the-Top
Applications (Facebook, Baidu, etc).

SmartMesh and Meshbox are differentiated from the convention 4G/5G network
architecture by supporting billing, analytics, and value-added services within the Mesh
network. Thus, network operators can deploy Wifi equipment for the Access network,
and support many of the functions which were previously supported only in the Cloud RAN

SmartMesh® : HyperMeshTM Ecosystem

or Data-Center Cloud servers.
This allows the operator to dramatically reduce costs for
access networks, reduce the number of hops (3 or 4) and still retain the capability to
monetize value-added services.
For inclusiveness, members of a community are not dependent on Operators, and can
setup and run their own HyperMesh Infrastructure.
Thus, wealth is re-circulated within
the community through Peer-to-Peer payments for Wifi, Content delivery, Banking, and ECommerce.

4. Smart Grid Transactive Energy
Consider the traditional Electric Power System (EPS) which is composed of centralized Utility
Plants (coal, gas, nuclear) and a transmission and distribution network to the end customers.
Such a system is designed for the peak energy needed and is thus over-engineered for the worstcase. The energy transmission is one-way and is delivered just-in-time with no storage of energy
along the path (no buffering) from utility to consumers. Due to this Just-in-time nature, all the
energy produced must match the energy consumed, on microsecond timescales.
The EPS is one massive machine such that small variations in frequency and voltage can easily
occur, causing the entire system to crash, leading to black-outs.
Traditional Electric Power System :
Centralized, one-way, just-in-time Energy delivery

Recently, the penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) such as solar, batteries, and wind
is intensifying due to an exponential decrease in cost; while the cost of traditional energy sources
continues to rise. Rooftop solar will soon become cheaper than the transmission of electricity
from Centralized Utilities. So, even if the generation of energy is free at the centralized utility,
just the cost of transmitting that energy to customers will be more than the cost of solar panel
systems at each customer’s house [Seba].
Thus, consumers of electricity will also be producers of energy, and are treated as Prosumers.
This in turn enables the future Smart Grid, which supports peer-to-peer exchange of Energy
between Prosumers, which is cheaper, fault-tolerant, and can be controlled by the people (versus
a centralized authority, the Utility).

The US Department of Energy (DOE) Gridwise Alliance proposes a Transactive Energy architecture
for such a future Smart Grid [Gridwise]. Such systems have been implemented at several testsites [Powermatcher] [TeMix]. Transactive-Energy enables the next generation EPS revolution to
an Energy Internet (Enernet).
A Transactive Energy system requires optimizing an Ultra-Large-Scale System-of-Systems, the
most complex machine in the world (the Electric Grid)

Distributed, Meshed Communications Network
Realtime Control
Blockchain

The Electrical Network (IEEE 1547, 2030) must evolve from supporting Centralized one-way flows
to that of Decentralized and Distributed two-way flows. This network enables efficient energy
sharing between DERs, traditional generators, and prosumers. This architecture is likely to be a
Mesh architecture due to its distributed, fault tolerant nature.
As such, a Distributed, Meshed Communications Network is needed for Prosumers (IoT devices
and DERs) to communicate to each other to determine when and how to exchange Energy. A
MeshBox® network, using P2P communication is leveraged for communication between
Prosumers.

14

SmartMesh® : HyperMeshTM Ecosystem

Real-time control is needed in order to schedule Energy transfers between Prosumers. Such an
exchange of Energy can leverage Double-Auction Applications, with the help of AI, and
implemented in MeshBox®es, in order to support a distributed online or offline auction between
prosumers.
Blockchain is needed to support trusted peer-to-peer payment system between prosumers with
high Transactions-per-Second (TPS) throughput needed for such machine-to-machine type
communications and micro-payments. Only Blockchain provides the low-latency, high throughput,
and low-cost transaction fee performance which is required by Transactive-Energy. Traditional
fintech technologies are not suitable.
In a SmartMesh® and Meshbox® enabled Transactive Energy system, both Critical (hospitals) and
Flexible (Household appliances) Loads represent Application Tasks, each with Energy ServiceLevel-Agreements (SLAs: deadline, max power, energy, etc). Each Prosumer can thus run an
optimization algorithm based on an utility function such as Benefits minus Cost (primal-dual
optimization). Benefits include meeting Energy requirements, such as charging an Electric
Vehicle by 7am deadline; and Cost is measured as LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy).
The Fractals Realtime Autonomic Control Transactive Anti-fragile Layered System (FRACTALSTM)
[FRACTALS] is proposed for Transactive Energy, with the following benefits.


During natural disasters, there is often a lack of both power and communications.
makes sense to address both of these issues with a single, optimized solution.



SmartMesh® and Meshbox® enables off-internet communication between P2P User
Equipment, much like FRACTALS enables off-grid energy exchange between P2P
Distributed Energy Resources and Prosumers. That is, SmartMesh® and Meshbox® can
work without the Internet and FRACTALS constructs an Islanded Microgrid which can work
without the EPS Grid.



SmartMesh®/Meshbox® needs the energy provided by FRACTALS in order to operate,
while FRACTALS needs the communication and real-time control provided by
SmartMesh®/Meshbox® in order to implement the P2P auction between the energy
prosumers.

SmartMesh® : HyperMeshTM Ecosystem

In order to minimize the cost of MeshBox®, the requirements on the blockchain technology to be
integrated into MeshBox® are very stringent.
 Light-footprint CPU and Storage: The blockchain must be very light, able to run on a lowcost embedded CPU, and requiring very low Disk space requirements.
 High TPS: The blockchain and associated Smart-Contracts must be able to support
100,000s and millions of Transactions-per-Second to scale to a world-wide payment
system between people, as well as between IoT devices.
 Scalable TPS: As the number of MeshBox®es grows, the TPS must scale well. Some
consensus protocols, such as voting protocols require more consensus time as the number
of nodes increases, which is the opposite of what is needed.
 Multi-blockchain and tokens : Support multiple blockchain ecosystems and associated
Token-switchingTM between such blockchains, since different applications may make use
of different blockchains and tokens.

5.4 Spectrum and Photon Architecture
The following illustrates how Spectrum and Photon work.
Ethereum blockchain, and is now a public blockchain.

Spectrum was forked from the

Ethereum Raiden
Before discussing Photon, a basic State-Channel architecture, such as Ethereum Raiden is first
described. The following shows an arbitrary Raiden network (which SmartMesh® has also
© 2017-2019 SmartMesh® and Meshbox® Foundation Pte. Ltd, MeshPlusPlusTM Confidential
19

SmartMesh® : HyperMeshTM Ecosystem

implemented as “Smart-Raiden”), composed of an interconnection of State-Channels (Channels)
between Raiden nodes, which are required to be connected to the Internet.

Mediated Transfer through Raiden Nodes A, B, C, M, Z

M
This route would
have succeeded

Step 1:
A wants to send 10 tokens to Z

A

Step 2:
A-B Channel has AvailableBalance = 15, so 10 tokens can
be transferred from A to B.
10

B

Step 3:
B-C Channel has AvailableBalance = 16, so 10 tokens can
be transferred from B to C. 10

Step 4:
C-Z Channel has
Available-Balance = 6,
so FAILURE to transfer
10 tokens from C to Z

C

Z

A transfer is successful when a Route can be found from Initiator (A, the payer) to Target (Z, the
payee). Raiden payment (Transfers) can be either Direct-Transfers, which take place directly
between two Photon nodes, or Mediated-Transfers, which are routed through intermediate
Raiden nodes.
One issue is that, since Channels are setup by users, the associated Deposits (tokens which users
must lock into the system) will be minimal, and sometimes, routes cannot be found between
Initiator and Target. Also, the Raiden network cannot work without continuous connection to
the Internet.
SmartMesh® Photon
To solve the above limitations with Raiden, SmartMesh® has developed Photon, which is similar to
Raiden, but which is optimized to work on MeshBox®es, which, in-turn, do not require continuous
Internet connectivity. Also, using statistical multiplexing techniques and economy of scale
principles, high-deposit Core Channels are established between MeshBox® Photon nodes, which
ensures that routes are quickly found between payer and payee.

5.5 Spectrum and Photon Meets and Exceeds Blockchain Requirements
From the beginning of the partnership SmartMesh® blockchain technology, consisting of the
Spectrum blockchain, and Photon Payment Network (Secondary layer, Smart-Contract) has been
carefully crafted in order to meet the above requirements.

Light-footprint CPU and Storage
Spectrum is very light-weight, running on low-cost mobile CPUs in MeshBox®. This is due to
Spectrum’s Proof-of-Capability consensus algorithm which securely, and fairly gives all Spectrum
nodes an opportunity to Sign blocks. Since Spectrum is deployed with Photon from the
beginning, most transactions take place on Photon, which minimizes the transactions which need
to go on the Spectrum blockchain, therefore minimizing the disk-space storage requirements of
Spectrum.
Thus, Spectrum is much lighter than other blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which
require hundreds of GBytes of storage in order to run the corresponding blockchains. With such
a low storage foot-print, MeshBox® Disk Space can be primarily used to store Data and Content,
rather than being used to support the Spectrum blockchain.
The Photon network offloads most of the transactions from Spectrum by establishing StateChannels between Photon nodes and allowing for an unlimited number of peer-to-peer
transactions to take place between two Photon nodes, without needing to be recorded on the
Spectrum blockchain.
High TPS
Spectrum blockchain takes care of securely Allocating and Settling State-Channels, and then
allows Photon to manage all transactions between Photon nodes. Since only the allocation and
settling of Channels requires Spectrum consensus, and an unlimited number of transactions can
flow between the Photon nodes which use the State-Chanels, much of the burden is removed
from Spectrum and results in the entire Spectrum + Photon architecture being able support
millions of TPS.
Scalable TPS
As the number of MeshBox®es grows, the Spectrum+Photon TPS scales very well. This is
because the peer-to-peer transactions between Photon nodes can all take place concurrently, and
are thus highly parallelizable. Thus, the more Photon nodes there are, the higher the TPS scales.
Multi-blockchain and tokens
Not only does the SmartMesh® blockchain support the SMT (SmartMesh® Token) coin and MESH
token, but other blockchain tokens are supported as well, including ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum
and BTC from Bitcoin. This is done with Wormhole Universal Channel technology and the
Atmosphere architecture being developed by SmartMesh®.

6. Conclusion
The human race is at a fork in the road in which existential threats loom, even while innovation
provides us with the key to avoid extinction level events and strive towards a prosperous utopia.
Everything we do has the potential to move us toward either a Utopian or Dystopian world.
A HyperMeshTM Infrastructure leapfrogs that found in developed countries, through a socialeconomic paradigm shift.

In conventional infrastructure economics, consumers pay the service provider (internet,
electricity, etc) for the service. The service provider decides when and where to deploy services
(e.g. whether to install new cellular base-stations and where) and how much to charge for such
services.
A HyperMeshTM Infrastructure enables a Shared-ROI paradigm shift to enable social well-being
with grassroots Infrastructure deployment.
 Instead of the service provider determining when and where to roll out service, the
residents of a community decide when and where to deploy infrastructure such as
MeshBox® routers.

Residents earn tokens (money) by providing services (communication, content storage,
video streaming, and transactive energy) to their community neighbors.
This keeps the money within the community and keeps all of the autonomy for the
infrastructure deployment in the hands of the people who use the services. The
community, and residents, and guests help each other in a synergistic relationship in order
to bring prosperity to the entire community.

SmartMesh®, Meshbox®, and our ecosystem partners aim to move society in the right direction,
by providing a highly advanced Wifi Mesh Network solution with the Spectrum blockchain to
enable an Internet of Value. Such a HyperMeshTM infrastructure will soon be extended with
Transactive Energy using renewable energy and battery systems to provide highly robust energy
sources for remote areas.
The proposed solution enables blockchain based Fin-tech, high-throughput wifi-communications,
and a distributed content storage system, while operating

Together, with partners such as Satellite operators, LoRa technology providers, and SmartMesh®,
Meshbox® brings about a paradigm shift to enable Infrastructure deployment with Shared-ROI.
Instead of the service provider determining when and where to roll out service, the residents of a
community decide when and where to deploy infrastructure such as MeshBox® routers.
This whitepaper highlights how a HyperMeshTM Infrastructure, enabled with SmartMesh® and
Meshbox® technology can speed up the realization of an IoV Infrastructure, to bring dignity and a
sustainable livelihood for the 3.9 Billion people without internet access, 2 Billion people who are
unbanked, and 1.2 Billion without access to electricity [Paygo].
