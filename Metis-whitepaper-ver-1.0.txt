Abstract
4

Economic, social, cultural and geographical barriers
have been broken through globaliza�on in the past
few decades but there are s�ll some barriers to truly
create an interconnected world. Poor communica�on and language barriers are cos�ng companies a
lot of money every year yet not enough is being
done to mi�gate these costs.
Massive Open Online Courses (“MOOC”) availed educa�on to anyone with access to the internet to pick
up new languages and new skills. While barriers to
learning has been lowered with technology, a crucial
ﬂaw remained in the educa�on system where the
posi�ve beneﬁts to society from increased educa�on
may not be fully captured by each individual, who
may not seek to a�ain new skills as his individual beneﬁts may not outweigh the cost for him.
Tradi�onal educa�on curriculum is also rigidly
designed with li�le customiza�on for each unique
individual learning style or interests, which could
raise the diﬃculty for the student to learn and pick up
new skills. Me�s provides an innova�ve solu�on by
leveraging on Ar�ﬁcial Intelligence to automa�cally
customize educa�onal content for each student
based on their personali�es and interests.
Me�s seeks to create a be�er world by correc�ng this
misalignment by providing every individual with the
right incen�ve to acquire new skills which can then
be used to contribute posi�vely to society.

Market Size of Education

The Massive Open Online Course (“MOOC”) market size is expected to grow from USD 3.9 billion in
2018 to USD 20.8 billion by 2023, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 40.1% during the
forecast period by MarketsandMarkets Analysis.

It is not surprising that the MOOC market is expected to grow rapidly given that it is a course with
the op�on of free and open registra�on and is a publicly shared pla�orm with open-ended groups.
MOOCs integrate social networking and accessible online resources facilitated by leading prac��oners in their respec�ve ﬁelds of study. MOOC builds on the engagement of learners who self-organize
their par�cipa�on according to learning goals, prior knowledge and skills, and common interests.
The need of the scalable and economical educa�onal pla�orm to cater to the need of learners
across the globe is boos�ng the growth of the Massive Open Online Course Market at a high CAGR.
During this �me, several large MOOC operators such as Coursera sprung up as pioneers of reshaping
higher educa�on. It has a unique diﬀeren�ated value proposi�on to all stakeholders within the educa�on market including students, educa�on ins�tu�ons and prospec�ve employers of the students.

any student with an internet connec�on regardless of loca�on. Students are also aﬀorded full ﬂexibility on the pace of their curriculum through self-learning.

Coursera enrolls more students than any physical ins�tu�ons around the world and is able to reach
any student with an internet connec�on regardleCoursera uses proprietary technology to improve
the quality of learning such as providing real �me feedback and natural language parsing to engage
students which has proven to be a diﬃcult task in the past. A new development is also adap�ve
learning courses which adjusts the diﬃculty of the course dynamically based on the student’s mastery of the course material, allowing the curriculum to ﬂow at the pace of each student’s learning
ability. In the long-run, the data collected by Coursera on how students learn and �me spent on each
tutorial/lecture helps to create a loop which further enhances the quality of learning for future
course par�cipants.
An interes�ng development that Coursera has pioneered is the provision of creden�als for students
that have completed the course work in the form of a digital cer�ﬁcate. There are also services
which provides remotely proctored exams to ensure that the students were indeed the ones that
have completed the course work and have a�ained the level of mastery required.
Me�s will be improving on many of these aspects that Coursera has pioneered to further enhance
value for students taking MOOCs.

Trend for Education Globally

Source: World Bank

The value of educa�on and upskilling is widely known by young students and working professionals
worldwide. Government expenditure on ter�ary educa�on as a percentage of GDP has increased
signiﬁcantly across both developed and developing countries as countries sought to increase their
economic compe��veness and to provide be�er quality of life for their ci�zens.

The trend of increased expenditure on educa�on by governments globally is not a surprise given
that educa�on is shown to have a wide array of beneﬁts to both the individual and to society. On an
individual level, these beneﬁts include higher income poten�al, career advancement, skill development, and employment opportuni�es. For socie�es with higher level of educa�on, there typically is
a trend of higher rates of economic stability, lower crime, healthier popula�on and greater equality.
Posi�ve externali�es and beneﬁts to society also exist in the form of greater cross-border economic
ac�vi�es through exports and a more innova�ve workforce.
Switzerland, for example, a�ributes 10% of its GDP to its mul�lingual heritage. The country has four
na�onal languages: German, French, Italian and an ancient La�n-based language called Romansh.
Britain, on the other hand, is es�mated to lose out on the equivalent of
7

Metis Whitepaper

3.5% of its GDP every year, because of its popula�on’s rela�vely poor language skills.
According to a report by Economist Intelligence Unit, nearly half of the 572 senior execu�ves interviewed admi�ed that misunderstandings and “messages lost in transla�on” have halted major
interna�onal deals for their companies. 64 percent have also said that the poor communica�on
between counterpar�es have also nega�vely impacted their plans to expand interna�onally.

Source: World Bank

The share of popula�on with completed ter�ary educa�on has also increased signiﬁcantly across
both developing and developed na�ons between 1970 to 2010. Most no�ceably, na�ons which
have experienced the fastest economic growth such as South Korea, has seen the greatest increase
in propor�on of popula�on that has completed ter�ary educa�on.

Besides direct economic beneﬁts to society, there also exists other posi�ve externali�es and beneﬁts such as lower healthcare cost to society through delaying of demen�a and having a sharper
more produc�ve workforce and lower social cost due to unemployment arising from greater economic ac�vi�es an employability of mul�-lingual employees.
8

Metis Whitepaper

Presence of beneﬁts to society which is not captured by the individual results in underconsump�on
of educa�on if le� to the free market to decide the level of educa�on each individual should a�ain.
While increased government expenditure in educa�on has corrected some of these underconsump�on on the macro level, it does not have the precision required to give each individual the necessary
incen�ve to complete their educa�on on a micro level. To resolve this, Me�s has developed a
sustainable ecosystem built around the MET token to ensure that each student will be able to a�ain
their full knowledge poten�al.

Hurdles for MOOC Education
MOOCs have increased access to a�aining educa�on but comple�on rates for such MOOCs are typically abysmal with an average of 5 – 15% comple�on rates among students who enroll for MOOCs.
A study conducted by Columbia University showed that students enrolling for MOOCs tend to have
a high level of intrinsic mo�va�on when seeking new knowledge and increasing their educa�on
level. Yet notably, these students were incurring signiﬁcant opportunity cost to themselves in the
form of leisure �me, paid working hours and some even have to increase their personal expenses by
hiring addi�onal help to cover some of their du�es such as taking care of family. These resulted in
unfavorable dropout rates for MOOCs and resul�ng in the poten�al beneﬁts that society may
receive.
Dropout rates for online courses are es�mated to be 6-7 �mes higher than oﬄine courses based on
several studies. These users had the right inten�on of learning a new language which could bring
great economic beneﬁts to themselves and to society by enhancing quality of communica�on. However, the lack of immediate beneﬁts in the near term to compensate for their opportunity cost may
result in them failing to complete their educa�on.
Rice University’s Jones Graduate School of Business expects that if students who enroll for online
courses have skin in the game, through a commitment made in payment of school fees, they would
be more mo�vated to complete their courses. However, the cost of pursuing educa�on can become
a deterrence for students to enroll into courses hence it is an imperfect solu�on to increasing comple�on rate.

9

Metis Whitepaper

Me�s solves this issue by providing a direct economic incen�ve for users which is
representa�ve of the economic value to society that is not captured by the users
themselves. This is done without increasing the cost of pursing educa�on for the
students. In fact, through our pla�orm, it may be possible for students to even have
a ﬁnancial incen�ve to study and pick up skills that are in demand within society.
These students learning and picking up skills that the industry is lacking can earn
money while being educated.
Me�s enables this through our innova�ve proof-of-work to mine new MTS tokens.
To gain MTS tokens, users will need to complete milestones in their online courses.
For each milestone completed, the users will receive a corresponding amount of
MTS token as a reward for their work. The rewards received by the users will commensurate with their commitment to the learning and the expected gain by society
from the comple�on of the course.
As an added incen�ve for comple�ng the courses, students will also receive a gradua�on cer�ﬁcate along with any awards that they have received during their educa�on journey. These cer�ﬁcates and awards will be issued as non-fungible tokens
exis�ng as ERC721 tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain.

10

Metis Whitepaper

Our vision is to create a decentralized educa�on blockchain pla�orm where
students can be incen�vized to learn new crucial skills that are in-demand in the
economy and for eﬃcient alloca�on of resources to ensure that beneﬁts to society
are maximized. We believe that educa�on should be accessible, available and that
students should be properly mentored to achieve their fullest poten�al in life.

Token utility
The MTS token have several use cases:

1. Governance Token
a. MTS token owners can create governance proposals and vote on proposals that will directly aﬀect the
Me�s protocol. Some of the decisions that are inﬂuenced through vo�ng are:
i. Total rewards distributed upon comple�on of each course (courses in-demand by society can be voted
on to increase rewards earned from course comple�on to incen�vize more users to pick up the
course)
ii. Type of courses and educa�on ins�tu�ons that will be allowed to par�cipate in the provision of courses on the Me�s pla�orm
b. The minimum number of tokens required to create a governance proposal will be announced at a later
date and can be subject to change depending on the total circula�ng supply of MTS.
c. MTS token can also be delegated to trusted educa�on ins�tu�ons/organiza�ons who can cast votes on
behalf of the MTS users.

2. Staking by educa�on ins�tu�on
a. To qualify for the provision of courses on Me�s, each qualifying educa�on ins�tu�on will need to stake
a par�cular amount of MTS tokens to provide their courses on the Me�s pla�orm.
b. This ensures that the educa�on ins�tu�on provides quality educa�on materials for students who are
enrolled in the courses.

3. Staking by students to boost incen�ve rewards
a. Users can stake a certain amount of MTS token as a signal of their dedica�on to comple�ng the class.
Upon comple�on, they can receive mul�ple �mes of their rewards. (e.g. a user who has staked tokens
may receive up to 5 �mes more token rewards as incen�ve).
i. This system gamiﬁes the lessons taken and increase the incen�ve for users to complete their classes.
Users are also incen�vized to work harder to complete their classes earlier as it increases their rewards
upon comple�on.
ii. Staking can also reduce fees for certain selected classes in view of their support and belief in the Me�s
system.

12

Metis Whitepaper

4. MTS tokens can be used as a currency for payment of classes or for the redemp�on of rewards
for their work in comple�ng the classes.
a. Class fees may be discounted if payment is made using MTS tokens
b. Given that MTS token price may ﬂuctuate, Me�s pla�orm will be connected to external oracles to obtain
data on real �me prices of MTS token and peg the price of the classes and incen�ve according to the
current market price. This ensures that the incen�ve of the students from comple�ng the courses and
the payment received by the educa�on ins�tu�on remains stable.
c. MTS tokens can also be earned by students through a mentorship program. Students who have completed the course, can introduce new students to study in the program and they will serve as mentors to
guide the new students that they have referred to the course. Upon comple�on of the course by the
new student, the mentor will also receive a por�on of incen�ve as a reward to helping the new student.
Through our experience, we have discovered that mentorship has greatly enhanced the learning experiences of new students and increased eﬃciency of their mastery of new skills.

13

Metis Whitepaper

Me�s compe��ve advantage lies within our ar�ﬁcial intelligence solu�on which enhances
the student’s learning experience and helps the student to succeed in comple�ng the
course by appealing to his interests.
Courses that are taught in physical classrooms have the limita�on that the curriculum has to
cater to the majority of the students in the class, hence the curriculum is less eﬀec�ve overall. This prevents students who are in the tail end of the class, such as the top 10%, from
achieving their full poten�al by having course diﬃculty tailored to their needs. With A.I.

In the second phase of Me�s Gaea, our proprietary A.I. will be launched together with the governance layer of the Me�s pla�orm.
The Gaea Phase will also allow other third-party educa�on ins�tu�ons to provide courses on the
Me�s pla�orm. To ensure that the courses are of good quality, the new educa�on ins�tu�ons will
submit their course work to the governance layer who will vote on whether these courses should be
allowed onto the Me�s pla�orm. The educa�on ins�tu�on may also have to stake MTS tokens as
collateral to their commitment to ensure that the students on the Me�s pla�orm will have a quality

Minimum Viable Product - MYPOOL
MYPOOL – developed by eKYSS and will be the ﬁrst educa�on ins�tu�on that is directly integrated with the Me�s pla�orm.
According to Sta�sta, interest in studying Korean language is rapidly picking up at U.S. universi�es between 2006 to 2016. Looking at the long-term trend, the number of Korean language
students has nearly doubled since 2006. In terms of growth alone, it is the highest among the
top 10 languages.
The increase in interest for studying Korean was largely driven due to the inﬂuence of the
Korean Wave propelled by K-Pop and K-Drama. In line with the marked increase in Korean
language learning demand, it is expected that compe��ve online-based Korean language educa�on services will gain a great response in the market.
For this reason, Me�s is pilo�ng our educa�on blockchain pla�orm through a language
MOOC.

17

Metis Whitepaper

Our researchers have created and designed the app to be the fastest and easiest
way for users to learn a new language through deep experience in our ﬁeld. It is
crucial for users to have regular prac�ce through video tutorials and quizzes so
that the mind can commit the new knowledge to long-term memory and add
gainful mastery of the language for the student.
MYPOOL also leverages on ar�ﬁcial intelligence through a partnership with Saltlux, so that users are able to upload data on their view preferences based on their
Ne�lix or Youtube viewing history so that educa�onal materials will be customized and tailored to their interests to ensure that the classes are more engaging
for the users.
Based on tests, it is expected that foreigners who are looking to gain a basic level
of ﬂuency in Korean are able to do it in half a day as MYPOOL curriculum and content includes the latest trends and culture of Korea.
MYPOOL, which is currently available through the iOS appstore, supports English,
Chinese, Indonesian, and Vietnamese star�ng with a beta service in January, and
plans to con�nue expanding to languages other than Korean as well as support
