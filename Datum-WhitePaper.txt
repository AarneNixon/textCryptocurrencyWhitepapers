Executive Summary
Abstract: The Datum network allows anyone to store structured data securely in
a decentralized way on a smart contract blockchain. The DAT smart token
enables optional selling and buying of stored data while enforcing data usage
rules as set by the data owner.
Every day we create 2.5 Quintillion bytes of data, and 90% of the world’s data today
has been created in the last 2 years alone. Data stored grows 4x faster than the
world economy and contributes to a substantial shift in economic power and
source of economic value.
A lot of this data is created by individuals or organizations; browsing the internet,
interacting on social networks, uploading personal files, syncing devices and
shopping online. This data is owned and stored by large private organizations in
huge data silos where it is susceptible to selling, tampering, extraction and other
exploitation. The originator of the data mostly loses control over its data when
signing up to various services such as Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snap, Twitter
etc., that offer ‘free’ services in exchange for exploitation of data, e.g. Google’s
Gmail service reading emails and showing targeted ads as a result.
Datum proposes a network run on a secure smart contract blockchain that allows
all of its users to retake control of their data, not just the personal and habitual
1
data they produce every day, but also data from the (IoT) devices that they control.
Datum encompasses the following key elements:
A fast decentralized data store allowing users to store structured data securely
running on a smart contract blockchain
The DAT token enabling this data storage and sharing
The data marketplace, enabling individuals to monetize their data on their terms
Datum leverages BigchainDB and IPFS to provide an infinitely scalable,
decentralized data storage backend.
Data storage and data sharing is paid for by the DAT token.

WHITE PAPER ​V14

The Datum network will consist out of 3 Billion DAT tokens, with 1.53 billion DAT
tokens available in a public token crowdsale.
The Datum network aims to provide entities such as researchers, companies or
individuals the most efficient and frictionless access to data while respecting the
data owner’s terms and conditions. By becoming a dominant data marketplace,
Datum aims to revolutionize the existing data market where data creators are
rarely paid for the data and the monetization happens by middle men who do not
add any value.
The Datum network will support initiatives that aim to increase control of data by
their sources (e.g. individuals). We aim to work towards a future where data is
first and foremost owned by their creator (e.g. an individual posting an image) and
where the creator can choose to share, monetize or destroy this data based on
their own purview.
This is in stark contrast with current data silos which collect vast amounts of
humanities data under restrictive licensing terms, e.g. an individual giving up most
rights to their image when posting it on Instagram. We feel that legislation in many
regions is being worked on towards giving back more control of user data to the
users themselves and feel the Datum network is an important facilitator and
technical solution for such a future.
The Datum network aims to disrupt current data broker model by giving more
2
direct and better value access to users data. This in turn empowers users by
regaining control of how their data gets used and shared. Users are incentivized
to use the Datum network for data storage not only by privacy but also by
monetization incentives. The more users using the Datum network the more
powerful the momentum becomes, eventually users are able to insist that data is
stored and handled through the Datum network.
Datum can be thought of as a decentralized version of Apple’s HealthKit, but for
any type of data instead of just healthcare data. HealthKit has led to a massive
opening of data by participating apps, however it is stored with a centralized entity,
Apple Inc., and is only available within Apple’s ecosystem. We expect to see the

WHITE PAPER ​V14

same rapid adoption effect with the Datum network once it gains critical
momentum. Datum network is being built to enable the input of multiple types of
data, and allow user control of the said data types.

Background
We live in a knowledge economy where data is a strategic asset that allows
companies to acquire and maintain their competitive edge. The value of raw data
varies from a hundred cents to over several hundred dollars per individual. The
more it is enriched, analyzed and leveraged for specialized uses, the more its value
increases.
Despite the large-scale monetization of personal and business data, the only player
in the chain that is currently not getting paid is paradoxically the individual
him/her/itself - who happens to be ​the​ source of harvested data.
Your personal or corporate data is worth a lot of money. Facebook, Google and co.
all happily collect data in return for nothing. This is the chance to gain back control
of your data and determine if and when you want to sell it or share it.
There is a quote which most certainly define the world we all live in today:
“If you are not paying for the product, you ​are​ the product.” - Andrew Lewis, 2010.
The Datum network model could provide a basic income for everyone by allowing
them to monetize their anonymized data.
As user of Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and similar services - every
year you create an excess of US $2,000, created directly from your personal data
alone. For corporate entities, the value is even greater. This is only the value
represented by data in each of these “data silos”, when you connect this data, the
richer and wider the information, the more money it is worth.
What if you could monetize this data yourself, deciding yourself how much you are
willing to share in return for rewards and new opportunities.

7

WHITE PAPER ​V14

There is already a worldwide data market enabled by various data brokers that
collect all types of personal data from various databases, Datum is the secure and
3
decentralized alternative.

Stakeholders
Users
Submit data. Data can be personal or business data and collections thereof or data
from IOT devices and any other data source.
Storage Nodes
Provide compute power and storage capacity to store data in the de-centralized
network. Storage Nodes are part of the BigchainDB cluster that allows Datum to
provide global scale storage of submitted data.
Data Consumers
Any entity wishing to access data. Users can grant data under their precise terms,
either for free or for a fee.
DAT Token Holders
Govern the Datum network and provide the “fuel” enabling transactions on the
Datum network.
Datum focuses on empowering the users (the source of data).
Datum is Open Source and Free to participate. Fees are paid to store data, access
stored data and rewards are paid out for submitting data.

Privacy
Each piece of data in the Datum network is marked with usage terms during the
encryption. This way the user (the source of the data) can control in what way
their data is to be shared and used by others. The usage terms are controlled by
the DAT token smart contract.

WHITE PAPER ​V14

Users have full control over privacy settings and can fine tune with whom to share
data:
1. Share disabled
2. Share with specific, identified and known data consumers
3. Share with specific, identified and known data consumers for a minimum fee
4. Share with everyone
5. Share with everyone for a minimum fee

Datum Client
The Datum Client empowers users to take
control of all their data and optionally
share or sell their data through the
Datum network.
The Datum Client is being designed for a
large number of various platforms such
as mobile and desktop. We are also
designing support for embedded device
platforms used in IoT devices, electric
cars etc. to unlock the value of such
device data.
In the first phase the datum client will be
offered as mobile app for iOS and
Android.

Full Transparency means users can inspect the data that is being transmitted at
any time.
Traceable Access: Users can trace who accessed their data at any time.

Open Data
To allow humanitarian and other legitimate projects access to the data, these can
register as projects. The user clients shows currently running projects requesting
data access and users can control whether to give access or not based on their
decision.
An example could information from digital health devices to medical institutions
and researchers, or IoT devices in case of accidents such as natural disasters.

Datum - The Data Network
Datum solves the following key problems. By focusing on data represented as

pairs,
Datum
ensures
that
availability,
latency
and
query-ability/searchability are preserved and incentivized/rewarded.
All data is encrypted and protected using AES256-GCM with 256-bit key size for
every 128-bit block, ensuring data integrity.

WHITE PAPER ​V14

User Specs
The user (source of data) is looking to solve the following criterias:
1. Secure: ​Data is encrypted at source
2. Tamper Proof:​ Data is immutable
3. Unlock value:​ Data can be monetized
4. Storage:​ Decentralized storage
5. Privacy: ​Data is stored anonymously
6. Control:​ User stays in control of critical points such as:
a. Life of data
b. Detail of data
c. Future use of data

Data Consumers
Data Consumers can request for data. Ultimately, it is down to individual network
users to grant access to data. The credibility of data consumers is an important
aspect. As such data consumers should be incentivized to build a trusted track
record in handling data responsibly.
The Datum network puts great importance on “Know your Consumer”. While there
is an industry focus on “Know your Customer (e.g. YOU), there is hardly anything
advocating user’s right to know their counterparty. The Datum network fixes this
by empowering its users to determine who gets access to their data.

11

WHITE PAPER ​V14

Data Consumers can choose to disclose the following (or nothing):
1. Identity
2. General Privacy Policy
3. Use of Data
4. Lifetime of Data
5. Datum Network Trust Rating

Regarding data requests consumers can specify further data specific items:
1. Use of Data
2. Lifetime of Data

Data Network Incentives
The various parties and stakeholders making up the Datum network have different
incentives.
Users:
1. Control of use of data
2. Secure and infinitely scalable data storage
3. Monetization of data

Data Consumers:
1. Direct access to validated and verifiable data
2. Lower costs by eliminating “data broker” middlemen

Storage Node:
1. Rewards for hosting data and providing compute power

Data Validation
Initially the Datum Network will rely on buyers to validate data and regulate fake or
invalid data. However, the data validation mechanism can be implemented going
forward and Datum also plans to implement a trust ranking system for all users
(this includes owners of data and buyers of data as well as storage node
operators).

12

WHITE PAPER ​V14

1. Users can link their data to their verified identity such as uPort or Civic.
2. Users can enrich their data with social media and other profiles.
3. Users can enrich their data with trusted 3rd party validators.
An algorithm based on scientific method consensus, such as DSensor
4
SenseMaking , can be implemented.

WHITE PAPER ​V14

Use Cases
User submits data and gets paid by a consumer;
1. User submits a piece of data to the Datum Network using the client software. The
user pays gas to submit the data. As the data is encrypted, only the user can
provide a decryption key to all the interested parties.
2. A Storage Node receives the data and stores the data. The data is replicated to
many other storage nodes.
3. A Data Consumer declares interest to purchase the piece of data.
4. The User receives a data purchase request with the details such as purchaser and
price offered. He can agree to the purchase request or counter offer with a
modified proposal.
5. The User accepts the proposal, the user receives DAT Tokens and the decryption
key is sent to the Data Consumer who pays in DAT Tokens.

Data can be purchased as one-off, or on an on-going subscription basis.

WHITE PAPER ​V14

Token Economics
DAT is a utility token that can be exchanged for certain privileges on the Datum
Network. Such as participation in the data market and registration as the storage
node etc. Tokens exchanged for these activities shall be destroyed, as the supply of
DAT is fixed at issuance the net effect of these activities is that the supply of DAT
will decrease over time (deflation).
● Marketplace participation and activity drives spending (destruction) of
tokens for privileged services
Storage Nodes are paid fees for storing and transmitting data.

Overview of DAT Tokens flows in the Datum Network

Mechanics of the Token Economy described in this section are under review by
our legal counsel and subject to change.

Storage Nodes
Storage nodes require 3 resources:
1. Compute Power
2. Storage Capacity
3. Bandwidth
Storage Nodes are economically incentivized by DAT Token rewards, paid out as a
fixed percentage of each transaction and shared amongst storage nodes
according to their contribution of resources.

WHITE PAPER ​V14

Datum Artifact Structure
The Datum structure is as follows;
1. Owner
a. Can have no owner, one owner or several owners
b. Can be encrypted
c. Can be public
2. Metadata
a. Can be encrypted
b. Can be public
3. Time Stamp
a. Can be encrypted
b. Can be public
4. Data Payload

Data Network data storage structure example:

Data Retention
Storing data costs money. As such, Storage Nodes are incentivized to store data,
and the following section provides answers on questions around retention, e.g.
how long is data stored?
Datum proposes the following mechanisms;
Data is stored as long as storage is paid for, by either:
● Data Source
● Data Consumer
Different levels of availability and retention:
● Backup Safety:​ How many copies of the data exist in the Datum network
● Latency:​ Where do copies exist
● Retention:​ How long are copies retained

Network that have additional requirements on top of the
public network mechanics.
Complete Developer Ecosystem
Completion of functionality on the periphery of the Datum
Network that completes a full development stack to store,
share, monetize and analyze data, in particular solutions to
help with user authorization, data indexing and analysis of
stored data while still operating within terms set out by data
owners. We will also have completed implementation of a
legal framework that ensures storage of personal data in
the Datum Network is compliant (and exceeding) standards
of data protection within various jurisdictions.

DAT Allocation Overview
51% of all minted DAT tokens will be offered for purchase by the public under the
ticker symbol DAT. The crowdsale will take place on 29th October 2017 at 1 PM
UTC (GMT+0) and stay open for 31 days or until the hard cap of 61200 ETH is
reached. 75000000 (75 million) DAT Tokens were offered to selected investors and
the public as part of a Presale at the DAT Rate of 1 ETH = 10,000 DAT, which
started on 11th August 2017 and ended on 8th September 2017. Including bonus
offered to presale participants and adjusting for the DAT Rate change at time of
main Token Sale (1 ETH = 25,000 DAT) the total amount of Tokens sold in the
Presale was 214802742 (214.8 million) DAT Tokens representing ~7.16% of all
tokens.
29% of minted DAT tokens will be held in a reserve by the Datum Network GmbH for
community initiatives, user growth, business development, academic research,
and future market expansion.
20% of raised DAT Tokens will be allocated to DAT core developers, founders and
advisors with sales restrictions spread monthly over 2 years as incentive to
ensure long term alignments of interest and commitments towards the future
value of the tokens.

24

WHITE PAPER ​V14

Datum Budget
Funds raised will be allocated as follows. To mitigate volatile cryptocurrency
markets and to provide Datum Network GmbH with a runway of 24+ months, up to
40% of raised funds will be hedged in USD/EUR/BTC. A budget is outlined below
assuming a scenario where the first ceiling of 5000 ETH equivalent has been
reached.

25

WHITE PAPER ​V14

Datum Foundation Governance
Initially the Datum network governance is handled by the Datum Network GmbH, a
limited liability entity incorporated in Switzerland.
Longer Term we plan to migrate governance to a DAO empowering users and
stakeholders with direct influence and control over the network and its
development by transferring network governance to a Non-Profit Foundation
registered and supervised by authorities in Switzerland.

User Growth
Datum allows anyone to monetize their data on their terms. We plan to leverage
this in our user growth strategy. By rewarding users from the very beginning for
submitting data we expect to be able to drive accelerated growth. A referral
program will provide additional incentives to existing users to spread adoption.
26

WHITE PAPER ​V14

Conclusion
Datum will initiate a change in how people think about data. By empowering data
creators with a secure way to store and exchange their data, and a vibrant
marketplace to monetize this data, a new economic model will be created that
empowers consumers instead of large private companies.
The DAT token will facilitate compensation of data sources and storage nodes and
enable a new era of secure and decentralized data storage and exchange.
