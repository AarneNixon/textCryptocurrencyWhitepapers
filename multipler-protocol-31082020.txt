1. Introduction
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is the merger of traditional banking services with decentralized technologies. Essentially,
it involves a brand-new monetary system being built on public blockchains. Decentralization means that there is not a
single point of failure, as identical records are kept across thousands of computers through a peer-to-peer network.
Decentralized finance leverages on several key principles of the Ethereum blockchain
-

Huge and diverse range of ERC-20 digital assets.

-

Over USD 50 billion combined market cap of Ethereum ecosystem as of Q3 2020.

-

Utilising smart contracts to provide a fully secure, transparent and open decentralized financial system.

With skyrocketing Ethereum fees and the exorbitant costs of interacting with DeFi smart contracts, the MXX protocol
was designed to mitigate these gas fees through utilising ultra-efficient coding and optimisation architecture.
Multiplier introduces Simplified Stable Bonds (SSB) contracts, that offer the full benefits of bonds in a simplified version.
Users with Ethereum/ERC-20 digital assets can supply their tokens to the Multiplier protocol through SSB contracts as
a source of stable returns, without having to manage their assets, fulfill loan requests or take speculative risks.

2. Multiplier Protocol
2.1 MXX Utility
The MXX token represents ownership of the Multiplier ecosystem and is aggregated algorithmically according to
liquidity contributed to the Multiplier platform, an application that facilitates the collateralisation where users can
determine the tenure and interest rate on their underlying asset.
The MXX protocol is audited, decentralised, open-sourced and publicly available. This provides support of public
oversight and scrutiny of the entire ecosystem.
MXX tokens are not pre-mined, and only minted through transactions that contribute to liquidity on the platform or a
deposit that mints MXX tokens as a reward based on their underlying asset. Potential MXX holders are incentivised to
mint MXX through transactions, and will have voting rights towards the governance of the network.

2.2 Simplified Stable Bonds (SSB) Contract
SSB Contracts mint MXX tokens, offering users a stable yield for their underlying assets.
Multiplier allows users to create their own SSB contracts where they can determine the tenure and interest rate that
they want to earn on their underlying asset. Each SSB contract can have only one underlying asset. However, a user
can create multiple contracts for different assets.
There are no restrictions as to the number of contracts a user can create, subjected to the availability of the remaining
MXX tokens that can be minted.

2.3 Simplified Stable Bonds (SSB) Contract Creation
For each SSB Contract created, users will need to provide a burn fee in the form of MXX. This burn fee will be sent to
an official burn address, thus reducing the total token supply of MXX. This burn amount is currently set at 8% of their
MXX returns.
Tenure and Interest Rate is subjected to change and may vary.

2.4 MXX Token Burn Mechanism
There are 2 types of burn fees in the Multiplier ecosystem.
•
•

Burn fee during contract creation
Burn fee during contract early redemption

The above burn fees are sent to the official burn address to be burned weekly, permanently reducing the maximum
token supply.
This process happens in the following stages:
Stage 1: MXX is transferred to the official Burn Address 0x19B292c1a84379Aab41564283e7f75bF20e45f91
Stage 2: The MXX in the Burn Address is periodically burned and announced publicly.
Stage 3: The maximum supply of MXX tokens will be reduced accordingly on etherscan.io

2.5 Early Redemption
Users can choose to early terminate their SSB contracts prior to maturity. However, they will be subjected to a burn
fee.
The Burn Fee is calculated on the percentage of the current MXX minted throughout the contract.

2.6 Open Market
SSB contracts that are early redeemed by previous users will be put up for listing in the Open Market. Users can choose
to acquire these SSB contracts by putting up equivalent assets into the contract and continue to mint the remaining
MXX in the contract till maturity. SSB contracts in the Open Market are on a first-come, first-served basis.

2.7 Governance
MXX tokens will carry voting rights for the governance of the network and will allow the protocol to gradually transit
towards being entirely governed by the community.
MXX holders are directly affected by protocol changes in the blockchain, and the governance token will give the
community a voice as they can use their voting rights to make decisions on protocol developments. They will be able
to present proposals to improve programs and other MXX holders with voting rights may choose to support them.
The number of votes is proportional to their amount of MXX tokens. The move towards a decentralised governance
process will protect investor interests, reduce systemic risk and increase long term utility of the protocol.
We believe in (what we call) the Multiplier Effect, that decisions made by a large collective is better than decisions
made by a single entity.
Any MXX holder can make a proposal. MXX holders can use their MXX tokens to carry voting right for one or more
proposals. A minimum of 50% vote nomination is required to pass a proposal.

3. Implementation and System Architecture
3.1 Implementation System Architecture
The MXX protocol will allow users to create their own SSB contracts where they can determine the tenure and interest
rate that they want to earn on their underlying asset. The protocol will be publicly available, open-sourced, and free
to use.

3.2 Price Feeds
Typically, a Price Oracle is used to retrieve the current exchange rate of each supported asset. However, it is also
common that prices are manipulated by malicious actors to exploit the system. In order to avoid such an undesirable
situation, MXX protocol will use an internal price factor (mFactor) for each asset instead of relying on a Price Oracle.
Each assets’ mFactor will be provided and updated on a periodical basis. This mechanism provides a stable pricing and
a fair system for all users.

Eligibility and Regulatory Approvals u
No guarantees are provided for any prospective participants who wish to participate in Multiplier's token issuance, as
laws and regulations relating to cryptocurrency are highly restrictive and relatively undeveloped. They are likely to be
subject to regular changes and reviews by competent government authorities. Also, such laws and regulations are
likely to vary significantly among various jurisdictions and are subject to significant uncertainty.
Therefore, your ability to access marketplaces on which to trade MXX Tokens may be subject to new or changing laws
and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations and may adversely impact the liquidity and market
price of MXX Tokens. The ability of a holder to access, use, transfer and exchange MXX Tokens may be affected by
changes to legislation, regulatory guidance or actions, and judicial decisions. As such, there can be no assurance that
any new or continuing regulatory scrutiny or initiatives will not have an adverse impact on the utility or value of MXX
Tokens or otherwise impede the Issuer’s activities.

Not a Sale of Security Tokens
This whitepaper does not constitute a prospectus or financial service offering document and is not an offer to sell or
solicitation of an offer to buy any security, investment products, regulated products or financial instruments in any
