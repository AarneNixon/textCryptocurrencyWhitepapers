Execu-ve Summary
In this document we cover the main aspects of how Paytomat works and an
overview of what we think it takes to make transacRonal cryptos be used for
real world payments.
Paytomat is a set of blockchain soUware soluRons, already used by more
than several hundreds Merchants to accept crypto in cafes, restaurants,
beauty salons etc. Our product integrates into exisRng point-of-sale systems
or oﬀers a standalone soluRon without the need to purchase addiRonal
hardware. We hedge the risks, increase speed and streamline payments in
mulRple cryptocurrencies.
For the Сustomer, it’s as easy as scanning a QR code with our own or any
other compaRble crypto wallet, and pay in one of the 15+ cryptocurrencies
currently supported by Paytomat.
For the Merchant, the enrollment is free and is done either via their POS
(updaRng the soUware) or installing the Merchant App provided by
Paytomat.
The in-house developed proprietary system is now being migrated to EOS
and includes “Paytomat Core” in the form of an EOS smart contract and
services responsible for keeping Merchant accounts and balances, Merchant
interfaces (Merchant Web Panel, Merchant App, POS integraRons and
e-commerce plugins) and consumer apps (non-custodial cryptocurrency
wallets).

The technological placorm focuses on security, scalability, performance and
lowest possible cost. Ideologically, Paytomat focuses on bridging the
decentralized ﬁnancial world with retail, ensuring our non-compeRRve
posiRon with transacRonal cryptocurrencies and oﬀering an open
ecosystem for everyone to beneﬁt from – Relays, Gateways, Regional
Leaders, Customers and Merchants themselves.
A nascent decentralized payment system can only succeed with local
support – this is what Paytomat Regional Leaders are for. Companies or
individuals who oversee the local Gateways and Merchant enrollments, and
earn money for doing so.
Our in-house team brings together crypto-evangelists, math scienRsts and
security experts. We have led the soUware development businesses for over
10 years and our company is now 50+ people strong.

!4

Problem Statement
Centralized payment systems are akin to silos of ﬁnancial data dependant on
the banking system and an industry that is ripe for transformaRon.
Roughly two billion people are unbanked [1] and have liile or no access to
personal ﬁnancial services. The single most important part of the “be your
own bank” concept is the ability to pay with crypto at any local shop or
online. This is where most crypto oﬀerings fall short and “crypto-enabled”
payments cards that rely on central processors are not the answer.
What does it take to move from pure speculaRon using digital assets to real
tracRon and transacRonal cryptocurrencies really taking their niche of digital
cash? While the infamous “mainstream adopRon” could be far away, we at
Paytomat believe that there are concrete steps to grow the adopRon and
create real cases of transacRonal usage.
From the Merchant standpoint the current learning curve and legal
complicaRons might not be worth their Rme to start accepRng
crypto – there are technological challenges, administraRon of payments and
a vast pool of new coins to manage. Paytomat takes all of that oﬀ their
shoulders, bring new customers and even new markeRng and data analysis
opportuniRes.
For the Customer using ﬁat within their banking system there are costly
cross-border payments, strict KYC limitaRons and virtually no privacy
controls. Paying at local stores with crypto and being your own bank with
cryptocurrency wallet solves that too.

Market Overview
Digital Payments Industry
The balance of force in the payments industry conRnues to shiU towards
digiRzaRon. Thus, total transacRon value in the digital payments segment
was valued at $3,265,209m in 2018. If their growth dynamics remains the
same, the total transacRon value is expected to show an annual growth rate
of 13.5% resulRng in the total amount of $5,411,354m by 2022 [2].
At the same Rme, today the situaRon in digital payments segment is really
quite ambiguous. Visa and Mastercard sRll signiﬁcantly dominate the
payment landscape. In the US, for example, these companies account for
almost half of online payments [3].
However, the hegemony of major players is gradually wearing oﬀ.
Customers in key global markets use an array of local payment methods,
such as Alipay, Tenpay and UnionPay in China, Boletos and domesRc credit
cards in Brazil, SEPA direct debit, SOFORT, and Giropay in Germany [4].
With the increasing strength of new players on the market, new placorms,
technologies and even payment methods emerge in digital payments.
RespecRvely, there is an expectaRon for omnicommerce – the ability to pay
using the same method regardless of whether you’re buying goods in-store,
online or via a mobile device. This shiU precipitates a need for retailers to
adapt to fast, simple and secure mobile payments [5].

!6

Mobile Payments Industry
According to staRsRcs, the total transacRon value in the mobile POS
payments segment amounts to $391,435m in 2018, with experts predicRng
further growth of up to $1,328,244m with 977.2m members by 2022 [6].
On the other hand, 451 Research's VoCUL Leading Indicator survey [7]
shows that the percentage of consumers planning to use mobile wallets has
remained stagnant since Apple launched ApplePay, growing from 24% in
December 2014 to just 26% in September 2017. While contactless POS
penetraRon rates are increasing in the U.S., the value proposiRon for digital
wallets remains undeniably nascent. In order to change it, the next wave of
consumers, who are perfectly content with cash, cards, and smartphones,
which work well and are accepted ubiquitously needs to be airacted [8].
Although we can argue that this new kind of customer is already living
among us. In Britain alone, 22 million people are already managing their
current bank account from the screens of their phone. Industry analyst,
CACI, has predicted that 35 million people (72% of the UK adult populaRon)
will use banking services via a mobile app by 2023 [9].

!7

Cryptocurrency Industry
What exactly is happening with the cryptocurrency industry in this maier?
Let’s start with the good news: according to Coinmetrics [10], Bitcoin
transacRons dollar value has outperformed that of payment processors such
as PayPal and Discover by a wide margin. Moreover, transacRon fees of the
oldest crypto are 6,000 Rmes cheaper than tradiRonal ﬁat transfer – at least
according to Bank of America (BoA)’s own rates ($45 per transacRon,
compared to an average transacRon fee of $0.46 for Bitcoin) [11].
Around 7% of users from the largest cryptocurrency markets own crypto,
and another 4% plans to buy some in the nearest future (according to the
survey [12]). By 2018, around 25,714,000 people will own one or more
crypto-wallets. That number is almost 8 Rmes bigger than it was in 2015
[13].
However, there are signiﬁcant challenges which serve as barriers for in the
way of the whole crypto-industry development. One of the main issues is a
liquidity problem laying concealed by the media hype. The obvious fact is
that without driving a suﬃcient inﬂux of the real life transacRons into the
ﬁeld, the future of crypto is in real trouble.
Look for yourself: only 7.8% of $3.7 billion raised by various iniRal coin
oﬀerings in 2017 were actually related to payments [14]. While teams from
all over the world are working to resolve this issue, the total amount of
transacRons these projects generate is sRll criRcally lagging behind. This is
especially true in regions like Africa, LaRn America, South-East Asia, Central
and Eastern Europe.
What is the soluRon to this problem? We believe it lies in generaRng a
suﬃcient amount of real life transacRons and tracRon with the real
economy. How? Well, this document was created to answer this very
quesRon.

Solu-on Vision
Core Principles
Our core principles reﬂect values we want to introduce to the world of
cryptocurrency payments and technology in general:

•
•
•

•

•

Security. We will use all the power of blockchain technology to secure
each transacRon in our system.
Openness. We want our system to be transparent to all our clients and
open for new parRcipants that are able to add more value to our
ecosystem. This means trust [15], fairness and high scalability.
Privacy. While keeping the system open we care about user privacy. All
private data not essenRal for transacRon properRes will be kept safe.
Customers will be able to delete their private data upon request
according to the latest data privacy laws.
Convenience. Our intenRon is to provide a soluRon with minimal
barriers for Merchant adopRon, so they do not need to reinvent their
businesses just for a new payment opRon. We aim to create a seamless
processes of Customer-to-Merchant payments that are easily
understandable, secure and fast.
Greater good. Cryptocurrency, as with all other economies, is about a
shared community [16] and we want to give back to it. It’s essenRal to
provide all parRcipants of our network with nice beneﬁts to moRvate
them to spread the word, which, in turn will lead to mass adopRon and
greater tracRon.

!9

Customer Flow
If using crypto was easy, then everybody would use it. At the moment, that’s
simply not the case because there are too many steps involved to make a
single transacRon. However, the market matures fast and the future of
payments is basically knocking on an average person’s door.
The goal of Paytomat is to make payments easy and simple to use by a
person who has no technical or blockchain experRse. That implies that a
client only knows that Bitcoin is the same thing as cash, except digital.
Imagine Chang-Woo, a 26 years old sales manager in Seoul (South Korea),
surfs through the web and ﬁnds an awesome IT conference [17]. He enjoys
spending Rme checking diﬀerent projects but the one that really capRvates
his aienRon is Paytomat. The guys explain that whole cryptocurrency thing
in a human form and give him $10 worth of EOS as a giveaway to start
exploring and playing with it. He downloads a wallet on the spot and
receives his ﬁrst digital transacRon. From now on he’s a Customer.
As a curious person, he decides to ﬁnd a bar and get himself a drink with
this new form of payment. He opens up his Paytomat wallet and can clearly
see a few places on the map. He goes to the one that he wasn’t familiar
with, orders some brewskis and asks the waitress to pay with EOS.
The waitress steers him on over to mQR that is standing on the table.
Chang-Woo simply scans it, enters the amount in Korean won, chooses EOS
and clicks “pay”. AUer conﬁrming payment with his ﬁngerprint, the waitress
can see a push noRﬁcaRon on her phone. He looks at the wallet to check his
balance and realizes that he also received some tokens as a bonus for paying
in crypto. What a nice app.
He thanks the waitress, takes a selﬁe of his happy face and shares it on
KakaoTalk [18]. He receives lots of comments, and now has to explain how
this whole cryptocurrency thing works to his friends. He becomes popular.

!10

Merchant Flow
Camila, a 32 years old owner of a restaurant from Margarita Island
(Venezuela) has hundreds of tourists coming to her place every day. She is
doing okay, but the inﬂaRon rate seems to ruin her business [19]. The cash is
worth less hour by hour and the fees that credit card companies charge are
extremely high.
One day she decides to conduct extensive research on alternaRve forms of
payments that can save and improve her situaRon. That’s when she
stumbles upon Bitcoin. It is fairly new and volaRle but the risk is worth it.
Apparently she could open up a wallet and receive transacRons directly but
it’s way too hard to keep track of all of the non-cash related payments in her
point of sale system, which is why she ﬁnds a Paytomat plugin that supports
mulRple coins and is compaRble with her machine. She contacts the support
team and gets the whole system set up within a day. She puts
cryptocurrency sRckers on her front door and shares this amazing news
across all of her social media to airact customers.
With the help of a local team she also decides to host an event and explain
to locals the beneﬁts of using and accepRng crypto. The event becomes a
massive success and now Camila has even more customers.
Every day she now serves about 10-30 tourists from diﬀerent countries who
pay in their favorite crypto. By this point, waiters can print out custom
receipts with QR codes for each crypto and give them to clients in a
respeccul and presentable form.
Camila and all of the waiters can track the transacRons on their phones and
POS system and receive SMS or push noRﬁcaRons if required. Due to this
extra payment opRon Camila saves money and airacts clients from all over
the globe.

Architecture Overview
Intro
Paytomat system consists of the following components:
Paytomat
Core:
the
heart
of
the
system,
responsible
for
keeping
•
Merchant accounts and balances, keeping track of exchange rates and
most importantly – managing transacRon lifeRme ﬂow.
Core
Services:
addiRonal
enRRes
providing
Paytomat
Core
with
an
•
interface to various blockchains and external services. Among others
they include Relays (receive Customer payments), Oracles (conﬁrm
payments) and Gateways (handle Merchant seilements).
Merchant
Interfaces:
various
ways
for
Merchants
to
interact
with
•
Paytomat Core. These include Merchant Web Panel and Mobile apps,
POS integraRons and other interfaces.
• Paytomat Wallet: while Customers can use any app to pay the
Merchants, there is a wallet app speciﬁcally designed to make crypto
payments via the Paytomat system quicker and easier.

1. The Flow starts with the Customer informing the Merchant of the
intenRon to pay via Paytomat using one of the supported
cryptocurrencies.
2. The Merchant contacts Paytomat Core (via the Merchant Interface
used) to create a new transacRon for parRcular amount in ﬁat to be
paid in a parRcular crypto.
3. Core picks one of the Relays with the best exchange rate. It uses this
rate to calculate the amount in cryptocurrency for the Customer to pay,
takes available Relay crypto address and creates a transacRon with all
these details.

!13

4. The Merchant takes the transacRon details and provides the crypto
address and amount in QR code to pay to the Customer.
5. The Customer transfers crypto to the Relay.
6. Then the transacRon gets picked up by the Oracle, which calls the Core
to conﬁrm the payment. Also it noRﬁes the Merchant (via SMS or push
noRﬁcaRon) with a payment conﬁrmaRon.
7. Core marks the transacRon as conﬁrmed and charges Relay from the
EOS balance it staked earlier. Also, it transfers a corresponding amount
of ﬁat-pegged tokens to the Merchant account.
8. NoRﬁcaRon about successful payment reaches the Merchant, who can
now ﬁnalize interacRon with the Customer.
9. Customer is happy. All done!
Now let’s discuss all these components in more detail.

Paytomat Core
As menRoned before, Paytomat Core is the central part of the system. It
needs to be secure and transparent to all parRcipants. The best way to
guarantee this is to implement it as a smart contract on EOS blockchain [20].
Let’s explore the pros of such a soluRon:

•
•

•

Transparency: Paytomat Core smart contract code will be open for
review by third parRes. Also all data stored by the smart contract can
be accessed and reviewed [21].
Pseudonymity: all parRcipants in the transacRon are operaRng under
aliases, so no personal informaRon will be revealed to the public. Of
course, we are required to do some degree of KYC (depending on
Merchant jurisdicRon), however this informaRon will stay oﬀ the Core.
Security: is supported by the blockchain itself – all acRons are signed,
conﬁrmed transacRons are almost impossible to alter etc. This is
further supported by the fact that Paytomat Core will run on the main
EOS chain, so the security will be guaranteed by the whole EOS
ecosystem.

!14

•
•

•
•

Scalability: because Paytomat Core will run on the main EOS chain, it
will theoreRcally have access to all the computaRonal and storage
resources of EOS blockchain.
No ﬁnal costs: because of the way EOS manages resources [22],
parRcipants in the system do not pay for transacRons, but stake funds
to use storage, computaRonal and network resources as needed. If a
Merchant decides to stop using Paytomat, then all resources staked to
process transacRons can be refunded.
Performance: another EOS advantage is its speed. It already manages
thousands [23] and potenRally millions of transacRons per second.
There are some cons for using smart contracts like Paytomat Core (such
as varying resources cost or inability to contact external services from
the smart contract), but the pros vastly outnumber them.

Core Services
Core Services help Paytomat Core to communicate with the outside world.
Designed to be small and mostly self-contained, they allow for greater
scalability of our system.
There are 3 main services working with Paytomat Core:
Relays:
accept
Customer
payment
in
crypto
on
behalf
of
Paytomat
Core.
•
Oracles:
keep
track
of
Relay
payment
addresses
and
noRfy
the
Core
•
when payment is received.
• Gateways: responsible for processing Merchant seilements from
Paytomer Core in ﬁat or crypto.
There are other minor services working with the Core (for example, exchange
rate monitoring services, system admin trackers and noRﬁers and more), but
those 3 are the most important ones. Below we discuss them in greater detail.

!15

Relays
While working with the Core, Relays are completely independent from the
system and can be outsourced to anyone willing to accept a given
cryptocurrency. They could be exchanges or cryptocurrency core teams – all
they need is to stake funds, choose an exchange rate and provide a list of
addresses to accept crypto from the Customers. The rest (monitoring
payments and charging Relays from the funds staked) is done by the Core
and Oracles.
Relay interface with the Core will be open and fully documented and will
provide an open source reference Relay implementaRon for anyone to use.

Oracles
With the 3rd party Relays accepRng payments, there should be an enRty to
keep track of them and the enRre transacRon conﬁrmaRon process. This is a
job for Oracles [24]. Here is what they do:

•
•
•

Validate addresses provided by Relays.
Monitor Customer payments and noRfy Core to conﬁrm transacRons
when payments are received.
NoRfy Merchants about received payments.

Unlike Relays, Oracles will be operated by our team, at least in the ﬁrst
iteraRon of the Paytomat System.

!16

Gateways
AUer Relays receive crypto from Customers (and Oracles conﬁrm this
process) the Core adds the appropriate funds to the Merchant’s address.
These funds are represented by tokens pegged to a parRcular currency (like
USD-tokens, BTC-tokens etc.) issued by Paytomat Core. To turn these tokens
into an actual currency we’ll need Gateways.
There will be two types of Gateways – Crypto Gateways and Fiat Gateways
[25]. Crypto Gateways will be global and will not have any addiRonal fees.
However, since ﬁat seilement condiRons vary from country to country, Fiat
Gateways will be localized and might charge addiRonal fees. When
approving seilements, Merchants will be able to select a parRcular Fiat
Gateway which works for them the best.

!17

Merchant Interfaces
Here are some of the ways a Merchant can work with Paytomat Core.

•

•
•

•

Customer Web Interface: requires the least possible eﬀort from the
Merchant. Each registered Merchant gets a direct URL which can be
shared with the Customer. The Customer in turn opens this URL, enters
an amount and selects which cryptocurrency to pay in, and gets
presented with the crypto address for the transfer.
Merchant Web Panel: basically the same process, but requires the
Merchant to issue an invoice to the Customers and only show them the
resulRng crypto payment address [26].
Merchant Mobile App: much like Merchant Web Panel, but uses a
naRve iOS/Android [27][28] applicaRon which would be preferable and
easier to use.
POS Integra-on: If the Merchant already uses some kind of a POS
system [29]. We work directly with diﬀerent POS providers and
incenRvize them to add Paytomat payment support to their systems
with technical assistance from our specialists.
Any other custom integra-on: since Paytomat Core’s direct interface
will be thoroughly documented, it is possible for the 3rd party
providers to write their own integraRons with our input.

All these interfaces are to set up to make the Merchant’s work with
Paytomat easier. However we did not forget about the Сustomers, see what
we oﬀer them in the next chapter.

!18

Customer Wallet
By design our customers are able to pay with any cryptocurrency wallet [30]
[31]. Each transacRon has its own payment address that is just a regular
addresses in a paricular blockchain, and payment conﬁrmaton that comes at
the very moment the transacRon is added to the blockchain (or receives
several conﬁrmaRons, depends on the amount).
We have developed our own wallet to ensure the speed and convenience of
payments. Here’s what the users already have when using Paytomat mobile
wallet:

•
•
•
•
•
•

NaRve iOS and Android applicaRons.
DeterminisRc wallet with single seed phrase to backup all the private
keys in all the cryptocurrencies.
Monitoring balances on many addresses in the same wallet, showing
ﬁat equivalent with current exchange rates.
Payments in 9 cryptocurrencies (Q3 2018).
Support of EOS [32] and Ethereum tokens.
Faster transacRon conﬁrmaRon when using our wallet for payment.

Here are some features coming up in v.2.0 (currently in development):

•
•
•

•

Merchant catalog to help ﬁnd nearest Merchant where Customer can
pay via Paytomat.
Extra incenRves for using the system, like special oﬀers from
Merchants, premium currency airdrops etc.
For registered users extra-features not directly connected with
Paytomat: keeping synced address book, payment to other users in the
system without knowing their address (by username), single-click EOS
account creaRon etc.
Built-in exchange between diﬀerent cryptocurrencies.

!19

Paytomat Tokens
PTM Token
PTM is a parRcipant incenRve token represented by EOS asset. The PTM
pool is emiied once at the Paytomat Core smart contract launch. Part of
PTM pool is designated to smart contract account to be distributed between
Paytomat parRcipants with every transacRon. Another part of PTM pool will
be issued in exchange for PTI tokens.
From every transacRon we take a 2% exchange rate margin in paid
cryptocurrency and distribute it this way:
• 5% – Paytomat Core;
95%
–
used
to
liquidize
PTM
tokens.
•
We distribute 87.5% worth of PTM tokens to all Paytomat ecosystem
members.
At the same moment, we calculate PTM tokens for this amount from current
value of PTM token and distribute them like this:
50%
–
Merchant
that
accepted
cryptocurrency
payment;
•
• 10% – POS vendor that processes Merchant’s payments (or Paytomat
team if there’s no speciﬁc POS assigned);
10%
–
Regional
Leader
that
manages
Merchants
and
POS
vendors;
•
7.5%
–
Paytomat
masternodes
[33];
•
5%
–
Relay
that
provided
cryptocurrency
address
to
accept
customer’s
•
selected cryptocurrency;
5%
–
DAO
[34]
fund;
•
the
rest
(12.5%)
stays
in
Liquidity
Reserve
to
support
token
value.
•
The Masternode is an EOS account that staked 1,000,000 PTM tokens in
Paytomat Core and has voRng rights in the network governance.

!20

PTX Token
Customer incenRves are a bit more complex than PTM tokens, as they are
Red to parRcular bonus programs for a region [35]. We plan to create a
family of EOS assets that will represent value for a Customer in a parRcular
region. This will either be direct value PTX token that can be used as a sort
of payment inside the Paytomat system, or group of tokens that will directly
represent parRcular goods that can be exchanged for real product inside a
network of Merchants that chose to parRcipate in such a program.
Partnering with an exisRng bonus system is also a viable opRon. In this case
we will establish a gateway to convert PTX tokens to that program’s assets
or vice versa.

!21

Paytomat Tokenomics
Tokens Alloca-on
At Paytomat, we designed a token based on deﬁniRve market rules and
fundamental economic principles. We ensure that PTM and PTX tokens are
used acRvely by our ecosystem members.
PTM tokens are created during the launch of Paytomat Core smart contract
that generates and distributes tokens. AUer the tokens are generated, there
is no chance to create PTM tokens, as there are no mining acRviRes
associated with the Paytomat network. The total supply of PTM to be
distributed is 3,600,000,000 PTM.
As a result, PTM tokens allocaRon can be described as the following:

3%

5%
Public

15%

Team
Liquidity Reserve

10%
4%
2%

61%

Advisors
Merchant Incentive
Legal
Customer Incentive

!22

Based on lockup periods for diﬀerent stakeholders and incenRve models for
both Merchants and customers, we can know precisely the total number of
tokens available on the market each month, thereby helping to prevent
price manipulaRon of PTM token.

Liquidity Reserve
Liquidity Reserve is a pool of tokens that are used as incenRves for
transacRonal usage within the Paytomat network.
Paytomat intenRonally distributes less PTM tokens to ecosystem members
to create less selling pressure on PTM tokens, which means that demand is
projected to be always greater than the current supply.
As the iniRal PTM Liquidity Reserve will be exhausted, Paytomat Core will
start to buy PTM tokens from the open market for EOS accumulated from
transacRon exchange rate margin.
An ongoing purchase of PTM tokens from the exchange will help to establish
an environment where PTM token value correlates with the purchasing
power and habits of cryptocurrency customers and the number of
Merchants who convert cryptocurrency into local ﬁat currency. In other
words, PTM token shows an approximate dynamic of growth or decline of
the market involvement.

!23

Paytomat Labs
Paytomat Labs is our sandbox for ideas, concepts and code. Pet projects and
oﬀ the wall iniRaRves that could become future core features are
documented and tested here. Paytomat Labs is what allows us to ﬁlter
through the ideas – someRmes building a prototype, someRmes just
producing a youtube video and ge|ng the discussion started.
The latest project graduated from the Labs is our mQR – the uniﬁed
Merchant QR that enables the Customer to pay with any wallet and any
crypto supported by Paytomat without requiring any addiRonal point of sale
