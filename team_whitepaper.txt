TEAM Overview
1.1.

Abstract. 10 Reasons to Support

1.

TokenStars is the first celebrity management platform on blockchain.
We’re building an ecosystem that will provide celebrities, fans and advertisers with
advanced tools and incentives for deeper interaction and engagement.

2.

Our platform consists of 12 integrated modules that allow participants to connect in a
new way. Designed as a toolkit, the platform allows users to combine different modules
to achieve the required features and capabilities.
Based on their functionality, the modules are part of 4 different layers:
1.

Crowdfunding layer, enabling promising talents and celebrities to raise funds.

2.

Infrastructure layer, providing functional tools (like voting and scouting) for key
platform activities.

3.

Fans Community layer, allowing the celebrities to grow their social capital by
expanding their loyal fan bases and offering the fans the desired involvement by
communicating and participating in activities with their favorite stars.

4.

Advertising layer, delivering smart & transparent data and an engaged audience to
brands for more efficient advertising campaigns (by enabling advertising smart
contracts and exclusive merchandise sales).

3

3.

TokenStars solves 4 major problems of market participants:
1.

Talents & Pros:
a.

‘Young talents need financial support’. We provide financial support to young
talents at the critical junior age, so they don’t drop out of professional sports
and entertainment industries. This significantly increases their chances for
success.

b.

‘Established players need help with advertising sales’. We offer representation
and marketing promotion to established pro athletes and media personalities
that are already attractive to sponsors but were overlooked by traditional
agencies.

Token implementation: TokenStars receives advertising commissions (15-30%, both
from pros and talents) and fees from supported talents’ future income (5-70%,
depending on the industry), which must be paid in TokenStars tokens. So, the
brands and supported talents will buy tokens on the exchanges from token holders
to pay for our services.
2.

Fans desire much closer interaction with celebrities and more influence over sports
clubs and players. We provide fan communities with a wide range of exclusive
options and products that allow them to participate, analyze, critique, deconstruct,
fantasize and connect with their favorite athletes and media personalities.
Token implementation: by participating in these interactions, fans earn and spend
TEAM tokens, increasing the demand and the turnover of tokens.

3.

Advertisers. Brands seek a combination of transparent advertising formats, as well
as more engaged audiences. TokenStars offers brands an opportunity to access a
highly involved fan audience and increase the efficiency of campaigns by
implementing advertising smart contracts.
Token implementation: the endorsements and promotional services will be paid in
tokens (fully or as a part of the TokenStars commission), so the higher the amount of
advertising campaigns, the more tokens will be demanded on the market.

4.

Blockchain implementation ensures transparency and scalability of operations. We
have chosen blockchain as the underlying technology of the platform to allow us to build
a transparent and verifiable system for all platform participants, especially for fans,
advertisers, talent scouts, and regular token holders.
1.

TokenStars platform will record in the blockchain ledger the events of interactions
between the participants, such as voting results, applications from scouts, auction
bids, and advertising clicks.

2.

Our platform will be based on two interacting blockchains - Ethereum for the tokenrelated operations, and a private blockchain for the internal platform operations:
which was chosen because tens of thousands of people (with millions of participants
in the future) will interact on the TS platform, so all these transactions will generate
millions of recorded operations. Using the Ethereum blockchain to record such a
large number of events would be impractical because of slow transaction speed and
high transaction-related expenses.
4

3.

5.

Implementing Ethereum ERC-20 standard compatible tokens allows us to avoid the
usual difficulties with fiat currencies such as low speed and regulations related to
cross-border payments.

Proven business model. We have started with tennis and successfully completed the
ACE token sale in October ’17. We have already started proving our concept:
1.

Signed the first contract with a PRO tennis player - Veronika Kudermetova, winner of
21 international tournaments (No. 58 in WTA ranking in doubles) and

2.

Launched a marketing project with Ekaterina Makarova (Olympic Gold medalist in Rio
2016; the winner of Wimbledon, US Open and Roland Garros; No. 33 in WTA singles /
No. 3 in doubles).

6. We’re launching the TEAM TokenStars vertical, which will combine celebrity
management activities in other sports (football, hockey, basketball, poker and others)
and entertainment (movies, music).
7. TEAM token (Ethereum, ERC-20 standard compatible) is a utility token, designed to
enable interaction between fans, celebrities (prospective talents & successful pros),
advertisers, scouts, and regular token holders. TEAM tokens will serve as the platform’s
internal currency and will be used in 10 modules.
Most of the interactions between the participants will require usage of TEAMs:


payment of agency commissions from advertisers and supported talents;



providing incentives to fans and external agents, who discover the prospective
talents (scouts) and promote their favorite celebrities (promoters);



making betting bids;



participating in the voting polls;



getting access to exclusive offers from celebrities.

This will result in higher token turnover, driven by TokenStars’ business growth.
8.

TokenStars disrupts a huge industry. TEAM targets a giant and fast-growing market.
The total global sports and entertainment celebrity management market exceeds $100+
billion1 in contracts under management and annual revenues of up to $20 billion2.
The sports and entertainment industry is booming now:
1.

Contracts under management among the top 40 agencies increased by +10% in 2017.

2.

UEFA Champions League budgets, distributed to the clubs, increased by 2.3X over the
last 10 years, amounting to $1.32 billion in the 2017/18 season.

3.

The total prize money in the Grand Slam Championships has dramatically increased
4X during the last 15 years.

https://www.forbes.com/sports-agencies/list/ [$43 billion of contracts under management in sports (sports
contracts are less than <50% of total industry]

https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/market-research-reports/arts-entertainment-recreation/celebritysports-agents.html [Assuming the US market (agencies’ annual turnover exceeds $10 billion) to be 40-45% of global]

1

4.

The worldwide sports analytics market (which targets the scouting of prospective
athletes and growing audience engagement) is expected to increase at a CAGR of
40.1% over the next five years and excel to $4 billion.

5. The project disrupts the huge incumbents’ business and shares the created value
among the community members.
TEAM is a global project looking for players and sponsors worldwide (this means higher
market size, higher diversity, and less dependency on local regulations).
9.

TEAM targets an enormous fan base, which can earn and spend tokens on the platform.
We aspire to introduce more than 4 billion sports fans3 to the blockchain world. The top
20 football players have 1.4 billion followers4 across the most popular social media
platforms.
TokenStars has established partnerships with major media platforms (for tennis we have
signed a partnership deal with major sports media such as Tribuna.digital and
https://www.sports.ru/ with 12.5 million MAU). We put special emphasis on global PR
and marketing among the non-geeky sports fans. The message ‘be part of the next
Ronaldo’s success and get exclusive offers from this star’ will resonate with them.

10. TokenStars has assembled a top-notch sports & entertainment advisory board that will:


share its expertise to stimulate project growth,



help us select the most promising talents, and



attract a large audience of users to the TokenStars platform.

TEAM Project Vision
3.1.

Core Idea

The core idea behind TokenStars is to bring interaction between stars, fans and advertisers to a
new level, and solve celebrity management industry problems.






Stars: talents and pros. In an era when professional career development highly relies on
the ability to attract social capital and access funding sources, stars need more ways to
get discovered by the audience and sponsors.
Fans. The balance of celebrities, fans, and media has shifted dramatically. Fans no longer
just watch. In real time they participate, analyze, critique, fantasize and connect with
their favorite stars.
Fans need innovations that will provide opportunities for interaction and two-way
communications with celebrities.
Advertisers. Brands seek new channels of promotion with a highly engaged audience
and demand transparent and adjustable tools to run advertising campaigns.

We understand that in order to encourage collaboration between a huge number of participants,
TokenStars shall develop scalable digital solutions and competitive incentives for all parties.
Therefore, we’re building a modular blockchain platform that will allow participants to combine
its blocks and achieve the desired results. Eventually, it will change the way celebrities connect
with their fans and advertisers, making it more efficient and valuable.
We’re introducing the TEAM token to empower the interaction between parties. TEAM tokens
(ERC-20 standard) will serve as a form of access to the TokenStars platform and as an internal
currency required for the majority of operations and transactions within our ecosystem.

3.2. Solving market problems
TokenStars solves 4 major problems of market participants:
1.

Talents (future stars). We provide financial support to young talents at the critical junior
age, so they don’t drop out of the professional sports and entertainment industries. We
also help them to attract an audience and accumulate social capital from the beginning
of collaboration, to start their professional career with a sufficient handicap (in
comparison to their peers).

2.

Pros (active sports & entertainment stars). We offer representation and marketing
promotion to established pro athletes and media personalities that are already attractive
to sponsors but were overlooked by traditional agencies.

3.

Fans desire much closer interaction with stars and celebrities and more influence over
their favorite clubs. We provide fan communities with opportunities to communicate in
real time, choose future stars, and become involved in celebrities’ activities.

4.

Advertisers. Brands seek a combination of transparent advertising formats, as well as
more engaged audiences. TokenStars offers brands an opportunity to access a highly
involved fan audience and increase the efficiency of campaigns by implementing
advertising smart contracts.
11

3.3. TEAM token
We create TEAM tokens (Ethereum ERC20 standard compatible utility tokens) to facilitate the
engagement between different participants on the platform. TEAM tokens will serve as:
1.
2.

A form of access to TokenStars platform features that verifies the token holder’s rights
to participate in the activities conducted within the ecosystem.
An internal currency – tokens will be used as a form of settlement in the transactions
conducted within the platform. This will also allow us to avoid the usual difficulties with
fiat currencies such as low speed and regulations related to trans-border payments.

There are 3 ways platform participants may acquire TEAM tokens:
1.
2.
3.

Join the crowdsale (total supply will be limited by the number of tokens created at the
crowdsale).
Buy tokens on the crypto exchanges.
Earn tokens within the platform for completing actions and accomplishing tasks.

12

Platform and Technology
4.1.

Platform Architecture

The TokenStars platform is built of 12 integrated modules that allow us to implement all
activities of the project. The modules are divided into four distinct layers:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Crowdfunding layer;
Infrastructure layer;
Fans Community layer;
Brands and Advertising layer.

TokenStars platform is designed as a toolkit, allowing users to combine different modules to
achieve the required capabilities and to encourage interaction between the celebrities, fans (as
well as regular token holders), advertisers, professional talent scouts and promoters.
A detailed description of the modules’ functions and architecture can be found below in this
section of the White Paper.

4.2. Use of Blockchain
Our choice of blockchain as the underlying technology of the TokenStars platform allows us to
build a transparent, scalable and verifiable system for all platform participants, especially for
fans, scouts, promoters and advertisers. We will provide fan community leaders with tools to
audit the records of the distributed blockchain ledger to prove the transparency of interactions
and avoid potential conflicts between the participants.
13

Our platform will interact with tens of thousands of people (up to millions in the future). We
aspire to introduce more than 4 billion sports fans6 to the blockchain world. For reference,



The top 20 football players have 1.4 billion followers7 across most popular social media
platforms.
The estimated number of FC Manchester United followers is 659 million people.8 This is
possibly the largest fan base in the world for a football club.

Furthermore, we plan to work with celebrities not only in sports, but also in entertainment
(movies and music), and expect to have a huge user base.
Every event such as recording a vote in a poll, collecting a report from a promoter, receiving
auction bids, or registering advertising clicks will generate a blockchain write operation. Our inhouse advertising will be using blockchain to record all important events for further analysis.
The daily number of these events can reach millions.
Using the Ethereum blockchain to record such a large number of events would be impractical
mainly because of slow transaction speed and transaction-related expenses.
Therefore, we’re planning to develop the TS platform based on two interacting blockchains:
1.
2.

Ethereum for token-related operations and
A private blockchain for internal platform operations.

TokenStars private blockchain will be built as a network of nodes, maintained by the Company in
the early stages of platform development. Later, we plan to delegate the rights (partially or
fully) of the nodes’ maintenance to the leaders of the fan community, who will be invited to
become part of the network. This will allow us to create a truly distributed network,
uncontrolled by any single party, in the true spirit of blockchain.
We also plan to take advantage of distributed blockchain technology for fast and efficient
scaling of the platform. Network node operators will be able to audit blockchain operations to
judge possible conflicts.
TokenStars will produce easy-to-install packages of the software required to run a network
node and will provide all necessary instructions and worldwide 24/7 support. Network node
operators will be compensated for their efforts with TEAM tokens.

4.3. Technological Stack

TokenStars is considering various solutions and approaches to private blockchain
implementation. We are expecting the best results from Hyperledger Fabric, which is an opensource blockchain framework implementation and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by
The Linux Foundation. Hyperledger Fabric was initially contributed by Digital Asset and IBM.
TokenStars Hyperledger Fabric based network will be interacting with the Ethereum network
through the inter-platform API we plan to develop.
The planned technology stack includes:


Amazon AWS Ubuntu virtual servers for private blockchain node deployment.



Third-party E-Commerce suite, customized for cryptocurrency and tokens. Shopify is the
candidate technology.



Advertising module with a combination of solutions by Google, AppNexus, Amber Data
and Iponweb.



Solidity and Golang for blockchain development.



ReactJS, Android Studio, XCode for user interface development (please see the examples
of prototypes in the next section).



Some of the implementation will be outsourced to trusted parties with total quality
control from our side.
15

4.4. Modules implementation
TokenStars platform is designed as a toolkit, allowing users to combine different modules to
enable and encourage interaction between celebrities, fans (as well as regular token holders),
advertisers, professional talent scouts and promoters.
TEAM tokens will serve as a form of access to the platform and its internal currency.
TEAM tokens will be used among 10 modules (excluding ‘personal’ STAR ICO modules).
We’re creating TEAM tokens (Ethereum ERC-20 standard compatible utility tokens) to facilitate
engagement between different participants on the platform. TEAM tokens will serve as:
1.
2.

3.

A form of access to TokenStars platform features, that verifies the token holder’s rights
to participate in the activities conducted within the ecosystem.
An internal currency – tokens will be used as a form of settlement in the transactions
conducted within the platform. This will also allow us to avoid the usual difficulties with
fiat currencies, such as low speed and regulations related to trans-border payments.
A form of expression of the community’s opinion. TokenStars platform will provide
TEAM token holders with the opportunity to express their opinion regarding operational
issues of the TokenStars’ business through the decentralized community voting (DCV)
mechanism (please find more details in Section 7.1 of the ACE White Paper).

ACE tokens, which were created to fund operations within the tennis industry (crowdsale
completed in October 2017), will also be integrated into the joint TokenStars platform
infrastructure.

Crowdfunding Layer
Comprised of 3 modules, it enables promising talents, combined in groups, and individual
globally-known celebrities to raise funds.

Talent Support Module
The talent support module is part of the
crowdfunding layer. It will be based on Ethereum
smart contracts that will implement management of
the funds collected during the token sale. As talent
support practice involves payments in fiat currency,
it requires an API connected to the external
cryptocurrency exchanges. Transactions to the
exchanges can be verified by blockchain analysis
tools like etherscan.io. Access to the module’s
functions will be limited to authorized employees of
TokenStars.
For Stars: Allows prospective talents to raise funds for professional development
For Fans: Provides access to the TEAM ecosystem and allows them to share in the success of
future stars.

16

Fans support future stars by buying TEAMs at the token sale. TokenStars finds promising talents
(by utilizing scouting and voting modules) and signs contracts with them. Rising stars receive
money to train, improve their skills, and participate in youth competitions. When talents become
successful pros, they start paying the platform commission from sponsorship deals and salary
or prize money. Commissions are paid only in TEAM tokens, which are bought on the market
from the fans (regular token holders).
The Talent Support Module is one of the basic ways to enter TEAM ecosystem and redeem
tokens for various services and interactions not only with rising talents, but also with
established pros, to whom TokenStars provides marketing support.
Case study: Fans support 14-year old ‘Maria Sharapova’; she wins Wimbledon at 17. The
platform receives a 20% commission from prize money and advertising contracts, paid in
tokens.
STAR ICO “Time Tokenization” Module
TEAM token won’t be applied to use this module.
This module will be utilized only by STAR token, designed for personal ICOs of celebrities (STAR
token will be announced later and will be sold at a separate crowdsale event).
STAR ICO “Income Tokenization” Module
TEAM token won’t be applied to use this module.
This module will be utilized only by STAR token, designed for personal ICOs of celebrities (STAR
token will be announced later and will be sold at a separate crowdsale event).

Infrastructure Layer
This layer combines 3 modules that provide functions and capabilities for key platform
infrastructure activities, implemented in combination with modules from other layers.

Talent Scouting Module
The talent scouting module implements platformbased interactions between TokenStars, talent
scouts (represented by professional part-time
scouts, youth coaches or incentivized token
holders) and TEAM token holders who have
volunteered to become Analysts. This module is
tightly integrated with the voting module.

For Fans: Allows them to become scouts, submit applications for prospective talents and earn
TEAM tokens.
17

The most general use case is illustrated by the diagram and is explained below.

TokenStars decentralizes the talent sourcing process to ensure a high-quality flow of
candidates. Unlike traditional agencies with a limited number of in-house scouts, TokenStars
creates a Global Scouts Network, encouraging scouts with well-balanced stimuli to bring the
most talented players to our platform.
1. Any TEAM token holder can become a
Scout by signing up on the platform’s
website or in the app. The person’s
Ethereum account is one of the
required fields. The new scout must
be the holder of at least one TEAM
token to apply. Token balance is
automatically verified by the platform
through the Ethereum API.

18

2. The token holder becomes a scout
and gets access to special platform
functions that allow him or her to
propose new rising talents.

3. Talents pass automatic screening
(based on their youth stats and
results) and offline assessment
conducted by TokenStars licensed
scouts, which provides information
for the future selection of candidates
for voting and contract proposal.

4. Any token holder can register as an
Analyst and gain access to the
talent’s data and to the voting.
Measures will be taken to protect the
sensitive personal information of the
talent and the scout.

5. Analysts can vote for or against signing a contract with the new star candidate. The
number of votes equals the number of TEAM tokens held by every analyst. The voting
is conducted in the private blockchain of the platform and can be further inspected by
the community in case of any doubt or conflict.
6. TokenStars signs the contract with the future star and confirms it in the system, and
this triggers immediate and automatic transfer of TEAM tokens to the recruiter’s
Ethereum account.

19

7. The scout continues his or her work with
players and submits periodic analytical
reports on their performance.

8. Analysts review the reports and can vote for or against contract renewal with (a) the
talent and (b) Head of Scouting Network, who made the final proposal on signing the
contract with the talent.
9. TokenStars renews the contract with the approved talent and approves the completion
of the task, and an additional reward is paid to the scout who provided the talent’s
application to the platform.
10. The recruiter continues his or her work with the stars with periodic reviews by the
supervisor and the analysts, receiving automatic payments in TEAM tokens after every
iteration.
11. TokenStars holds periodic prize draws where the most active analysts have better
chances to receive rewards in TEAM tokens and other possible prizes. The prize draw
rules and conditions will be announced prior to the voting.
Case study: ‘Juan’ notices a promising young football player, submits an application to the
platform, and receives a $10K payment in TEAM tokens.

Scouts should receive significant amounts of money for successful recommendations in order to
be motivated. It is important to note that Scouts will receive compensation only for their work
performed through the TokenStars platform, as described in the table below. No compensation
shall be paid if the Scouts do not perform any of the respective actions.
Scouts’ compensation will be paid only in TEAM tokens.
The compensation amount and prices may be amended from time to time in order to reflect
evolving business purposes and provide fair compensation and pricing for the performed
efforts.

Voting Module
The voting module is used as an infrastructure
support for other modules. The platform will
hold polls among token holders on the
significant decisions: one of the most meaningful
use cases of voting is described above in the
Scouting section, where fans provide their
opinion on approving new players or renewing
the Head of Scouting contract.
For Stars: Allows them to accumulate a greater audience and social capital to increase the value
for sponsors.
For Fans: Provides an opportunity to participate in talent selection and influence decisions made
by their favorite stars. Active engagement in voting will allow them to earn additional tokens.

Hereinafter in the whitepaper: For simplicity, the compensation amounts in tokens are calculated at the exchange
rate of 1TEAM = 1$. Actual compensation amounts in tokens may be changed and will reflect the fluctuations of the
exchange rates.
21
9

This module will be also tightly interconnected with modules from the Fan Community layer,
when it will be used as a standalone mechanism for polls conducted by celebrities. For example,
fans might be able to vote for the title of a pop star’s new album, which dress to wear at a redcarpet ceremony, or how to celebrate a scored goal (thus the star becomes a ‘live Tamagotchi’
for the fans). For the star it brings greater audience engagement and publicity, which
consecutively results in higher interest from advertisers.

Betting Module
TEAM token holders will be able to take part in
different betting events involving TokenStars
talents and celebrities.
For Fans: Allows them to earn or spend tokens
by placing a bet on the results of various events.

The stakes and the prizes will be accepted and paid only in TEAM tokens. Betting will be
implemented as an Ethereum smart contract with automatic payments to the winners.
As a part of the infrastructure layer, the Betting module will be pluggable into other modules,
like an online competition stream.
Case study: ‘Roberto’ participates in TokenStars quarterly fantasy football tournaments, makes
the most accurate predictions, and wins the 1st prize.

Fan Community Layer
Allowing celebrities to grow their social capital and offering fans higher involvement and
participation.
This layer is comprised of 3 modules, allowing celebrities to expand their loyal fan bases and
offering fans the desired involvement by communicating and participating in activities with their
favorite stars.

Bounty Fan Club Module
The Bounty Fan Club module is one of the key
elements of the TokenStars platform, furnishing
talents and celebrities with a tool to develop
their audiences in an efficient and structured
manner. Stars will assign tasks (e.g., creating
content, promoting social media accounts) to
their fans, who may volunteer to become
‘Promoters’ and help their favorite star to
succeed.
22

All communications between promoters, stars and TokenStars employees will occur through the
platform. All payments are made with TEAM tokens and are automatically processed by the
platform and its API to the Ethereum network.
For Stars: Allows them to achieve meaningful results with the help of highly engaged fans by
assigning them particular tasks.
For Fans: Enables regular participation in the star’s activities, provides an opportunity to earn
tokens and become the leader of the fan club.

The most typical case is illustrated by the simplified diagram below:

TokenStars’ involvement in the process requires two activities – promoter recruiting in the early
stage, and supervising in the later stages.
1.

The TokenStars recruiter invites new promoters by publishing vacancies on the project
website, through social media, and a mailing list of registered token holders. Also, these
vacancies will be published and promoted in the star’s social media accounts and
communication channels, which will allow them to invite a greater number of fans to the
TS platform. The vacancies include a general description of the tasks the candidate
agrees to undertake.

2.

Any person willing to apply to a new promoter position (may be a current token holder or
regular fan, who has to buy a TEAM token to apply) can fill out the form on the platform’s
web site. The person’s Ethereum account is one of the required fields. The candidate
must be the holder of at least one TEAM token to apply. Token balance is automatically
verified by the platform through the Ethereum API.

3.

The TokenStars recruiter further interacts with the candidates, conducts an online
interview, and approves hiring.
23

4.

The candidates become promoters and commit to the specific tasks assigned by
TokenStars. Remuneration conditions are also agreed between the parties as part of the
task confirmation procedure. Every confirmed task becomes an immutable record (smart
contract) in the platform's private blockchain ledger and will be available for
independent inspection from the community for the purposes of conflict resolution.
Sensitive personal information of the promoter and the task will be cryptographically
protected from third parties.

5.

A detailed description of possible tasks, fees and policies is provided below the case
study.10

6.

Upon completion of the task, the promoter reports it through the platform interface. With
the report, s/he must provide some proof of task completion, e.g., a link to a social
network post or a screenshot.

7.

The promoter’s supervisor approves the task completion and this triggers immediate and
automatic transfer of TEAM tokens to the promoter’s Ethereum account. Every platform
user will be able to check his or her token balance directly on the account page.

8.

New tasks can be suggested by the
promoter’s supervisor or recurring
ones can be updated. Every new or
updated task and conditions must be
confirmed both by the promoter and by
the supervisor.

Case study: ‘Madonna’ has 700,000 fan club members worldwide. They start getting paid for
their work in tokens, and promote the star.

Hereinafter: Fees are indicative and may vary depending on the business’s operational and financial requirements.

monetize.
For Fans: Allows them to connect and communicate with their favorite stars, and gives them the
feeling of being heard.

Contests & Charity Module
TokenStars platform itself or particular stars
can hold contests among their fans with prizes
in merchandise or tokens (i.e. previously
described in scouting and voting modules).
Trust in the contest mechanism is essential.
For Stars: Allows them to increase publicity
and grow their audience.
For Fans: Allows them to earn tokens or
valuable prizes.
Contests run on the platform can have a different look, rules and mechanics, but they will all be
built on the blockchain-based backend module. This will ensure accountability of the organizers
to the community, especially in regard to prize distribution.
This module is planned to be released during the TEAM token sale. It will demonstrate the
Christmas Charity event.
Case study: A singer, ‘Enrique’, releases a new album and needs to engage his fan base. He
launches a global contest with hundreds of prizes for participants, incl. participation in real-life
events. The community trusts the results.

Brands and Advertising Layer
3 modules, providing smart solutions & transparent data to brands for running more efficient
advertising campaigns with a highly engaged audience.

Advertising Smart Contracts Module
The smart contract builder for brands allows:


Brands to use the CPA model (paying only for
desired actions, verified by the system).



All parties to trust each other (the payment will
happen if the advertising really brought actions,
not bots).



Users to simplify negotiations and lower
transaction costs.

For Stars: Additional monetization.
For Advertisers: Efficient and transparent campaigns.
The platform will allow users to run custom advertising campaigns such as full-screen video
takeovers or full-page branded design, or content will be implemented by an in-housedeveloped AdTech solution that will include the following components:


A wizard that will allow advertisers to specify campaign parameters and upload all
creative formats.
28



A smart-contract based advertising engine that will assure transparent measurement of
advertising performance by logging important events into the blockchain.



Custom analytical tools that will give insights into campaign results enriched by our
audience’s knowledge.



An API connected to an industry-standard analytical suite such as Google Analytics,
which will allow advertisers to integrate results from TokenStars campaigns into
common reporting practice.



Platform tokens will be used as a universal method of payment for custom advertising.



The Data Management Platform (DMP) is the system for collecting and analyzing
information about the project audience, and using the data for targeted advertising
campaigns. As the majority of the project’s visitors will be authorized users, we will have
a unique and precise insight into the audience properties, which we will further enrich by
integrating with one of the leading data management platforms.



We will use a third-party ad server or SSP to run display advertising campaigns on our
web properties and apps. Audience segments collected with the DMP will be available for
campaign targeting exclusively for the advertisers of TokenStars.



We will be able to run programmatic advertising campaigns on behalf of our clients using
exclusive audience data and one of the industry-standard media buying solutions (DSP).

Case study: ‘Coca-Cola’ wants to place an ad on the ‘Snowboarders’ Instagram page and pay $50
for every submitted application. In a few clicks, they develop a contract and make a deal.

Brand relations
Stars attract a large audience, and even promising talents
will be of great interest to advertisers. Advertising can be
in different online and offline forms like sponsorship,
uniform branding and souvenirs, billboards, banners at
events, etc.
The promoters supervising the stars will be able to earn
rewards by offering advertising opportunities to local and
global brands. Promoters’ bonus for new clients and
commissions for all subsequent advertising budgets will
be paid in TEAM tokens.
For Fans: Opportunity to earn tokens.
For Stars: Additional monetization.
For Advertisers: Efficient and transparent campaigns.
Case study: ‘Wei’ finds a local SMB advertiser for a player in China and gets a 10% commission.

29

E-commerce
TokenStars and brands will be selling different
star-related items through a web store. The items
can be purchased with TEAM tokens for fixed price
or at an auction.
The E-Commerce module of the platform is
planned to be implemented with a third-party
solution that allows payments with Ethereumbased currencies and tokens. Shopify is one of the
platforms we’re considering. We are aware that
other crypto-oriented e-commerce suites are in
development now. We will choose the bestperforming e-commerce suite at a later platform
development phase.
Case study: Tennis star ‘Maria’ has a contract with Nike; she sets up an online store with
autographed Nike products via the TokenStars e-commerce module.

Technology-specific disclaimer
We are living in a time of rapid technology development. The description above is based on our
current knowledge and the current state of technology. The TokenStars development team
reserves the right to change approaches, architecture, elements of the technology stack, etc. as
a result of future R&D findings that may present us with better options to solve the
technological challenges we face.

30

Roadmap
Disclaimer
Developing a sophisticated product is a non-linear process that might require changes and
pivots along the way. The roadmap below reflects our current understanding of the module
implementation sequence. We’re constantly learning from the market, industry professionals,
and our stars and users, and continue to tune the process and the sequence accordingly.

Our team is working hard to deliver the modules and other critical system components. Above
you can find estimations of timeframes for the availability of the main TokenStar Platform
functional Modules. The information in this table is preliminary and is subject to changes based
on our team’s discretion. We will make such decisions based on our understanding of what
brings the most value for the business.

Operations / How it works
6.1.

Promoting Successful Professionals

Celebrities appearing in popular print advertisements and TV commercials is nothing new using a celebrity spokesperson is a strategy that has been widely used throughout history. From
Britney Spears to Lionel Messi, famous people of all ages help turn a product endorsement into
a huge part of pop culture.
Why do celebrities need TokenStars?
There are lots of great professionals who are promoted poorly by their agencies and aren’t
exposed to additional opportunities. TokenStars helps celebrities increase their audience and
grow their social capital.
What can TokenStars do for celebrities?






bring new endorsement contracts (additional revenue, on top of their existing revenue)
sign non-exclusive promotion agreements
increase the level of fan communication, e.g. online and real-life interaction
enhance audience involvement
strengthen the brand and increase the advertising value

We have an internal team responsible for attracting sponsors. TokenStars and Natura Siberica
have already launched a project with Ekaterina Makarova, Olympics and Wimbledon tennis
champion! Ekaterina Makarova is ranked No. 3 in WTA doubles, Wimbledon 2017 champion and
Olympics 2016 champion, and the winner of 15 WTA tournaments. Natura Siberica is the first
Russian brand of high-quality organic cosmetics with an annual revenue of approximately
$50M.14
TokenStars adheres to the standard commission rate of 20% of the celebrities’ net contract
money (excluding local taxes) and 20-25% of sponsorship revenue (if the sponsor is brought by
a promoter, the latter receives a 10% commission of the first contract and 2% of all the
following deals paid in TEAM tokens).
Some of the most successful collaborations between a brand and a celebrity can bring millions
of dollars. Here are some cases of successful football player endorsements:

14

https://www.facebook.com/TokenStars/posts/358492834620603
34

Usually, the higher-ranked the player, the more brands
are willing to pay.





Cristiano Ronaldo has an astonishing lifetime $1
billion contract with Nike.
Lionel Messi had a 7-year $140 million deal
with Adidas which was recently extended to
lifetime (amount is unknown).
Neymar has a $105 million 11-year deal with
Nike.

The estimations of endorsements for the year 2016 are
provided by Forbes15:




Cristiano Ronaldo earned $35 million that year
alone (approximately 38% of his total
earnings).
German star Mesut Ozil earned $7.5 million
(approximately 40% of his total earnings).

Here are some more cases of successful football player endorsements:
Case 1. Korean football sensation Park Ji-Sung, a
retired football player, serves as a club
ambassador at Manchester United. He enjoys a
10-year sponsorship contract with Nike
($430,000), and advertising contracts with Asiana
Airlines ($160,000) and Air Asia. The Nike contract
was the biggest ever awarded to an Asian football
player as of 2013. Among his past endorsements,
one might recall a lucrative contract with Gillette
which put him into their famous “trio of stars”
commercial, replacing Thierry Henry for
campaigns across Asia. His total net worth in 2013
was estimated at $23 million.16

Case 2. Shinji Kagawa, a 25 y.o. Japanese midfielder, currently enjoys a yearly wage of $2.8
million17 for his superior results at German Borussia Dortmund.

Not to mention that his professional achievements attracted a few lucrative endorsements with
Audi and Adidas18 totaling approximately $2.6 million.

6.2. Developing Young Talents
From the age of 8 to the age of 18, before young talents first start earning prize money at
tournaments or in Hollywood, they need to spend significant amounts of money:









to travel to tournaments or auditions
to study at a professional academy
to train with a professional football/vocal coach
to record demos
to buy equipment or musical instruments
to buy advanced medical insurance
to relocate to another city or country
to compensate one of the parents’ lost salaries (e.g., the EU forbids kids under 16 to
relocate alone, and it does not grant working visas for parents).

Lack of funding is a typical problem which almost all current stars face as juniors. They need
financial support and career development consulting.
TokenStars attracts sponsorship contracts and advertisers to young talent. This helps them
stay in the professional sports & entertainment industries, pursue their dream, and grow social
capital from the beginning of their careers.
Read more about tennis costs in the ACE White Paper.

6.3. Involving fans
Fans no longer just watch. They participate, analyze, critique, deconstruct, fantasize and
connect with their favorite players and teams in real time. Read more in the TokenStars
Marketing Strategy.

Thanks largely to digital innovation, being a sports fan has never been so emotionally charged,
or fun, as it is today. Over time, as fans have gotten more and more organized, the virtual
monopolies teams and leagues have enjoyed have been broken. When today’s most important
superfans talk, teams listen.
Fans nowadays have a huge impact on the sports industry:






Multiple fan boycotts have been called to protest the continued use of the Redskins team
name and logo. Boycotts have even been called for FedEx, which owns the naming rights
to the Redskins’ stadium.
Scottish Ranger Union fans hired an analyst to examine the financials of the
organization’s merchandise deal to discover that little profit was benefiting the club.
They organized an effective boycott to express their displeasure.
In Italy, Lazio soccer supporters boycotted a home match against Atalanta in protest of
President Claudio Lotito’s running the club after the sale of playmaker Anderson
Hernanes to Inter Milan and a series of bad outings. Only 2,000 tickets were sold in a
venue that has a capacity of 82,000. The club lost money and had to listen to the fans.

TEAM truly broadens modern fans’ perception of the entertainment experience. Fans earn and
spend tokens, participating and influencing the careers of celebrities. TokenStars platform
provides fans with tools to become closer to their idols, including:






online and real-life interaction with celebrities (e.g., a workout or dinner with a star, oneon-one video chat, etc.)
voting on significant decisions (approving new players, renewing the Head of Scouting
contract)
‘fantasy tournaments’ to select the best Scouts among the token holders
contests among their fans with prizes (in merchandise or tokens)
online stores and auctions with celebrities’ personalized goods.

All interactions require TEAM tokens: higher involvement means higher demand for tokens.

To introduce and attract fans to TokenStars platform, we have established partnerships with
major media (we have signed a partnership deal with major sports media such as Tribuna.digital
and https://www.sports.ru/ with 12.5 million MAU).
We put special emphasis on global PR and marketing among the non-geeky sports fans. We will
make special events (PR conferences, event sponsorships), participated in by our ambassadors,
become well known by the fan audience.

6.4. Attracting advertisers
Brands seek a combination of transparent advertising formats and more engaged audiences.
TokenStars platform provides brands an opportunity to access a highly involved fan audience
and increase the efficiency of campaigns by implementing advertising smart contracts.
1.

Each celebrity has a clear profile with detailed information on their followers and
marketing metrics – insights on followers, available stats and data on previous
partnerships with advertisers. Platform transparency allows advertisers to choose the
37

most 'suitable' celebrity to work with. Both successful PROs and rising celebrities can be
involved in partnership.
2.

To ensure even higher engagement and interest in the product, the platform allows
advertisers to merge the celebrity campaign with the e-commerce module. That means
advertisers can cooperate with celebrities and create online stores within the platform
with advertised goods and services. Online stores increase product awareness and
revenue.

3.

TokenStars platform will develop its own technical assets to provide efficient advertising
options:


4.

5.

Internal Data Management Platform (DMP) to collect and analyze information on the
audience to provide more precise targeting options.

3rd party ad server will allow users to run ads across the platform.

Using exclusive audience data and industry-standard media buying solutions (DSP)
will give users an opportunity to implement programmatic advertising campaigns.
The Smart Contract allows users to track campaign efficiency (information on traffic,
user engagement, user insights) and pass stats to the advertisers' side via an in-housedeveloped ad tech solution.
The Smart Contract provides lower partnership costs due to absence of intermediators
and ensures a clear pricing policy. All advertisers will know the final price and list of
services to be delivered.

Financial Projections
TEAM ecosystem combines different sports & entertainment verticals (except tennis, which is
covered by ACE token).
At the first stage we will concentrate on:


Stage 1: Football, poker, eSports and hockey.



Stage 2: Later we will add basketball, movies and music verticals to the TEAM portfolio.

This list may be expanded with other sports and entertainment businesses (baseball, cricket,
table tennis, golf).
The approach of having one token for many verticals grants TokenStars flexibility in discovering
new opportunities and reallocating resources to the most efficient lines of business.
It will also provide lots of synergies in operations, such as sharing advertising resources or
simplifying back-office processes (such as legal and accounting).

7.1.

Assumptions

We plan to choose the verticals and form the group of supported stars for the TEAM ecosystem
according to the following criteria:










Total number of fans worldwide.
Level of players’ compensation (salary), attractiveness for advertisers and size of
transfer market.
Ceilings for agents’ commissions.
Agent regulation (licenses required, etc.)
Competition between agencies.
Probability of athletes’ success (e.g. in boxing or Formula-1, very few athletes manage to
climb the ladder vs. poker, where thousands can participate in tournaments)
Total number of athletes in the upper league (only 20 drivers in Formula-1).
Capital requirements for the early years of training.
Degree of the sport's openness to outsiders (e.g. sumo seems to be closed for
newcomers outside Japan).

For the purposes of financial modeling we have split the verticals into two categories, based on
the key demands of the stars (promotion & representation or funding) and the expected term of
returns:
1.

Traditional sports category:
 Football, basketball, hockey.
 The vertical attracts a lot of fans worldwide, which provides additional opportunities
for communication with supporters and advertisers. Besides high salaries, football
and basketball stars earn a lot from sponsorship deals and bonuses, from 15 to 70%
of their regular wages (and even more for superstars like Cristiano Ronaldo and
LeBron James).
 Long-term development of talent (from junior to pro) & long returns.
39


2.

Major funding requirements at the junior stage are usually covered by professional
clubs.

Modern sports category:





Poker, eSports.
Stars (talents and even pros) from this category require funding for training and
participation in tournaments.
The returns are very fast (3-12 months), compared to the long-term development of
players in traditional sports.
Stars’ income in poker and eSports rely primarily on prize money earned at
tournaments, with only a relatively small part coming from advertising (~5-10%).

7.2. Revenues
We modeled expected players’ income over the course of their career.19 20 21 22
For the group of traditional sports stars, we have modeled the average player’s income
distribution (based on football, hockey and basketball stats), according to their age and
professional achievements.



We plan to form the following groups of stars and talents in the next 4-5 years:
o

Promotion: 40 stars (traditional sports) for promotion and advertising;

o

Funding: 15 talents from traditional sports and 20 from modern sports verticals.



These numbers are calculated for the scenario of the token sale reaching the hard cap of
$15,000,000. For a different amount, the model adjusts proportionally).



TokenStars receives a 20-30% commission (paid in tokens that should be bought on the
market) from every advertising or sponsorship contract, signed with a star.



TokenStars adheres to the standard commission rates of 5-10% of the stars’ salaries &
prize money in traditional sports and 50-80% rates in modern verticals. Before talent
repays initial funding, TokenStars has a priority right for revenue proceeds (up to 75%).

We’ve made tight assumptions in our baseline scenario: we did not include any superstars in our
projections and modeled the conservative rates of advertising commissions.

Major conclusions:



The project is estimated to reach breakeven 4 years after launch.
The accumulated revenue of the TEAM project will reach $95 million within 11 years after
launch.
o Most of the revenues are projected to come from advertising commissions (which
include proceeds from exclusive offers and communications with fans).

7.3. Use of funds
For the scenario of $15 million in funds raised, 26% will be spent on Tech and platform
development, 25% on players’ grants, 13% on marketing and 10% on advertising sales.

Token Allocation
TEAM tokens (Ethereum ERC-20 standard compatible utility tokens) facilitate engagement
between participants on the platform and serve as a form of access to the platform and its
internal currency.
There are 3 ways participants may acquire TEAM tokens:
1.
2.
3.

8.1.

Join the crowdsale.
Buy tokens later in the crypto exchanges.
Earn tokens within the platform for performing actions and accomplishing tasks.

Token Allocation

A Token allocation formula has been established to ensure a healthy distribution to:




Crowdsale contributors,
TokenStars’ employees and advisors, providing long-term motivation,
Community and network growth activities required to achieve financial and operational
goals.

The diagram below explains the structure of token allocation:

Contributors
45,000,000
60%

Network growth
& Community 15,000,000
20%

Max Supply
75,000,000 TEAMs

Advisors & Team
15,000,000
20%

The resulting maximum number of tokens is up to 45,000,000 for the token sale; up to
15,000,000 for team & advisors; and up to 15,000,000 for network growth. The total Max number
of created tokens, therefore, is up to 75,000,000.

43

The final number of created tokens will depend on the actual number of TEAM tokens sold
during the crowdsale. A difference between the maximum possible number of created tokens
and the number of distributed tokens will not be created.

Tokens distributed to the team and advisors are not immediately tradable. This aligns the
interests of the team with the long-term technical and business goals of the company. The team
and advisors’ tokens (20%) will be unlocked according to the following KPI accomplishment:


5% - List TEAM tokens on the exchanges;



5% - Sign first 3 players;



5% - Sign first 3 advertising contracts;



5% - Implement the 10 modules of the TokenStars platform.

8.2. Token Disclaimer
What are TEAM Tokens
TEAM tokens are software with cryptographic elements that are sold as a utility appliance for
the TokenStars platform. TEAM tokens are based on the Ethereum protocol and conform to the
widely-used ERC-20 standard.
TEAM tokens have their functional utility only within the TokenStars platform, and their creation
is conditioned by the need to develop an internal economy in the TEAM ecosystem that will
establish transparent and fair relations among the TEAM community.
TEAM tokens are intended to be used by their holders only for their designated purposes. The
number of such purposes may be increased over time, including, but not limited to, by means of
adding new services and features available in exchange for TEAM tokens.
TEAM tokens are intended for experts in dealing with cryptographic tokens and blockchainbased software systems.

Use of TEAM Tokens
Means to use and interact with the TokenStars platform. TEAM tokens carry the backbone
functions of the TokenStars platform. The full functionality of the TokenStars platform is
available only for TEAM token holders. We plan to place the TEAM tokens on cryptographic
token exchanges, giving an opportunity to openly buy them (to residents of countries where the
purchase of tokens does not violate local laws). A user seeking to enter the TokenStars platform
will have to buy TEAM tokens at such exchanges. Conversely, TEAM tokens could be sold at an
exchange if their holder would like to exit the ТЕАМ ecosystem.
However, legislation on the circulation of securities in certain countries, such as the United
States of America, People’s Republic of China, Republic of Korea and Singapore, may prohibit the
sale of TEAM tokens to the residents of those countries. When buying TEAM tokens, the
purchaser should be aware of the restrictions on their subsequent sale and is thereby obliged to
follow our instructions and/or those of the exchange when s/he resells them to other users.
Form of expression of TEAM community opinion. The TokenStars platform will provide TEAM
token holders with the opportunity to express their opinion regarding the particular operational
44

issues of the TokenStars business through the decentralized community voting (DCV)
mechanism, which is described in more detail in section 7.1 of the ACE White Paper.
These decisions, expressed through the DCV mechanism, will serve as the advisory guidelines
for the TokenStars management. The agency's management team and executives will
consistently take the results of TEAM community voting into consideration.
Form of settlement. TEAM tokens will be used as a form of settlement in the transactions
conducted within the TokenStars platform. In particular, TEAM token holders will be able to use
their TEAM tokens to purchase services and products to be offered within the TokenStars
platform, as specified in Section 7.2 of the ACE White Paper.
Means to power the TEAM platform's compensation system. The TokenStars platform builds a
well-balanced motivation system that encourages its agents, specifically Scouts, Promoters and
Advertisers, to perform their functions better, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the entire
TEAM ecosystem and its benefits to the TEAM community. To be motivated to use the
TokenStars platform further, its agents may receive compensation for their active participation
in the TEAM ecosystem, as described in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of the ACE White Paper.
Compensation will be paid in TEAM tokens, which allow the agents to participate in the growth
of the TEAM ecosystem.

What do TEAM Tokens NOT Represent?
TEAM tokens are not securities in any jurisdiction. This White Paper does not constitute a
prospectus or offer document of any sort, is not intended to constitute an offer of securities or a
solicitation for investment, does not pertain in any way to an initial public offering or a
share/equity offering, and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any
jurisdiction. TEAM tokens are not intended to be marketed, offered for sale, purchased, sold, or
traded in any jurisdiction where they are prohibited by applicable laws or require further
registration with any applicable governmental authorities.
TEAM tokens do not represent a loan to the Company. TEAM tokens are neither debt
instruments or bonds of any kind, nor any other form of loan advanced to the Company.
Acquisition of TEAM tokens, whether through the Token Sale or otherwise, does not grant to
token holders any right of claim on Company's financial or any other assets.
TEAM tokens don’t grant participation in the Company or its assets. TEAM tokens do not
provide token holders with any ownership or other interest in the Company. Acquisition of TEAM
tokens does not present an exchange of cryptocurrencies for any form of shares in the Company
or Company's assets, including intellectual property. Token holders are not entitled to any
guaranteed form of dividends, revenue distributions, or voting rights.
TEAM tokens are non-refundable. The Company is not obliged to provide token holders with a
refund related to TEAM tokens for any reason, and token holders will not receive money or other
compensation in lieu of a refund. No promises of future performance or value are or will be
made in respect to TEAM tokens, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of
continuing payments, and no guarantee that TEAM tokens will hold any particular value.

Company and is subject to change in line with ongoing research and development of the
Platform. This White Paper does not constitute an investment, legal, tax, regulatory, financial,
accounting or other advice, and this White Paper is not intended to provide the sole basis for any

involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause actual events or results to
differ materially from the estimates or the results implied or expressed in such forward-looking
statements or information.
TEAM tokens are not being offered or distributed to, as well as cannot be resold or otherwise

unlawful, unauthorized and fraudulent basis and in this regard shall bear negative
consequences.
Company neither offers or distributes TEAM tokens nor carries on business (activity) in any
regulated activity in Singapore, in People’s Republic of China, Republic of Korea or in other
countries and territories where transactions in respect of, or with use of, digital tokens fall

applicable governmental authorities.
Each purchaser of TEAM tokens is reminded that this White Paper has been presented to
him/her on the basis that s/he is a person into whose attention the document may be lawfully
presented in accordance with the laws of the purchaser's jurisdiction. It is the responsibility of
each potential purchaser of TEAM tokens to determine if the purchaser can legally purchase
TEAM tokens in the purchaser's jurisdiction and whether the purchaser can then resell TEAM
tokens to another purchaser in any given jurisdiction.

Appendix
Risk Factors
The acquisition of TEAM tokens involves a high degree of risk. Each potential purchaser of TEAM
tokens should carefully consider the following information about these risks before s/he
decides to buy TEAM tokens. If any of the following risks actually occurs, the TEAM platform and
the value of the TEAM tokens could be materially adversely affected.
The risks and uncertainties described below in this White Paper may not be the only ones token
holders face. Additional risks and uncertainties may also materially adversely affect the TEAM
Platform or the value of the TEAM tokens.

1.

RISKS CONNECTED TO THE VALUE OF TEAM TOKENS


No Rights, Functionality or Features. Tokens do not have any rights, uses, purpose,
attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied, including, without limitation,
any uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features on the TEAM platform. Company
Parties do not guarantee and are not representing in any way to Buyer that the Tokens
have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features.



Lack of Development of Market for TEAM tokens. Because there has been no prior
public trading market for the Tokens, the Token sale may not result in an active or liquid
market for the Tokens, and their price may be highly volatile. Even if the Tokens are
tradable in a secondary market, in practice, there may not be enough active buyers and
sellers or the bid-ask spreads may be too wide. The Token holders may not be able to exit
their token holdings easily. In the worst-case scenario where no secondary market
develops, a Token holder may not be able to liquidate his/her token holdings at all.
Exchanges or platforms that facilitate secondary trading of the Tokens may not be
regulated by the applicable laws.



Risks Related to Highly Speculative Traded Price. The valuation of digital tokens in a
secondary market is usually not transparent, and highly speculative. The Tokens do not
hold any ownership rights to Company’s assets and, therefore, are not backed by any
tangible asset. The traded price of the Tokens can fluctuate greatly within a short period
of time. There is a high risk that a Token holder could lose his/her entire contribution
amount. In the worst-case scenario, the Tokens could be rendered worthless.



TEAM Tokens May Have No Value. TEAM tokens may have no value and there is no
guarantee or representation of liquidity for TEAM tokens. Company is not and shall not be
responsible for or liable for the market value of TEAM tokens, the transferability and/or
liquidity of TEAM tokens and/or the availability of any market for TEAM tokens through
third parties or otherwise.



Tokens are Non-Refundable. Company is not obliged to provide Token holders with a
refund related to the Tokens for any reason, and Token holders will not receive money or
other compensation in lieu of a refund. No promises of future performance or price are or
will be made in respect to the Tokens, including no promise of inherent value, no promise
61

of continuing payments, and no guarantee that the Tokens will hold any particular value.
Therefore, the recovery of spent resources may be impossible or may be subject to
foreign laws or regulations, which may not be the same as the private law of the Token
holder.

2. BLOCKCHAIN AND SOFTWARE RISKS
2.1 Blockchain Delay Risk. On the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, timing of block
production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random
times. For example, the Cryptocurrency transferred in the final seconds of a distribution
period during the Token Presale or the Token Sale may not get included for that period.
Buyer acknowledges and understands that the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain may not
include the Buyer’s transaction at the time Buyer expects and Buyer may not receive the
Tokens in this regard.
2.2 Blockchain Congestion Risk. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are prone to periodic
congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also
intentionally spam the respective network in an attempt to gain an advantage in
purchasing cryptographic tokens. Buyer acknowledges and understands that Bitcoin or
Ethereum block producers may not include Buyer’s transaction when Buyer wants or
Buyer’s transaction may not be included at all.
2.3 Risk of Software Weaknesses. The concept of a token smart contract which creates the
mechanism of creation and distribution of TEAM Tokens (“Token Smart Contract”), the
underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) are
still in an early development stage and unproven. There is no representation and
warranty that the process for creating the TEAM tokens will be uninterrupted or errorfree. There is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities
or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of the cryptocurrency and/or the TEAM
tokens.
2.4 Risk of New Technology. The Platform, the Tokens and all of the matters set forth in this
White Paper are new and untested. The Platform and the Tokens might not be capable of
completion, creation, implementation or adoption. It is possible that no blockchain
utilizing the Platform will ever be launched. Buyer of Tokens should not rely on the
Platform, the Token Smart Contract or the ability to receive tokens associated with the
Platform in the future. Even if the Platform is completed, implemented and adopted, it
might not function as intended, and any Tokens may not have functionality that is
desirable or valuable. Also, technology is changing rapidly, so the Platform and the
Tokens may become outdated.

3. SECURITY RISKS
3.1. Risk of Loss of Private Keys. The Tokens purchased by Buyer may be held by Buyer in
Buyer’s digital wallet or vault, which requires a private key, or a combination of private
keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private keys associated with such Buyer’s
digital wallet or vault storing the Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens, access to
62

Buyer’s Token balance and/or any initial balances in blockchains created by third parties.
Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private keys, including by gaining
access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service the buyer uses, may be able
to misappropriate the Buyer’s Tokens. Company Parties are not responsible for any such
losses.
3.2. Lack of TEAM Token Security. The Tokens may be subject to expropriation and or/theft.
Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the
Token Smart Contract or the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to,
malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks,
smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open
source software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts may contain intentional
or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the Tokens or result in
the loss of Tokens, and loss of the ability to access or control the Tokens. In the event of
such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of the Tokens are
not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.
3.3. Risk of Ethereum Mining Attacks. The blockchain used for the Token Smart Contract is
susceptible to mining attacks, including double-spend attacks, majority mining power
attacks, "selfish-mining" attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks
present a risk to the Token Smart Contract, expected proper execution and sequencing of
the Token transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract
computations.
3.4. Failure to Map a Public Key to Buyer’s Account. Failure of Buyer of the TEAM tokens to
map a public key to such Buyer’s account may result in third parties being unable to
recognize buyer’s TEAM token balance on the Ethereum blockchain when and if they
configure the initial balances of a new blockchain based upon the TEAM platform.
3.5. Risk of Incompatible Wallet Service. The wallet or wallet service provider used for the
acquisition and storage of the TEAM tokens has to be technically compatible with the
TEAM tokens. Failure to assure this may have the result that Buyer of the TEAM tokens
will not gain access to his or her TEAM tokens.

4. RISKS RELATING TO TEAM PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT
4.1. Risk Related to Reliance on Third Parties. Even if completed, the Platform will rely, in
whole or partly, on third parties to adopt and implement it and to continue to develop,
supply, and otherwise support it. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third
parties will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet
anyone’s needs, all of might have a material adverse effect on the Platform.
4.2. Dependence of Platform on Senior Management Team. The ability of the TEAM project
team which is responsible for maintaining competitive position of the Platform is
dependent to a large degree on the services of a respective senior management team.
The loss or diminution in the services of members of the respective senior management
63

team or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional senior management
personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Platform. Competition for
personnel with relevant expertise is intense due to the small number of qualified
individuals, and this situation seriously affects the ability to retain its existing senior
management and attract additional qualified senior management personnel, which could
have a significant adverse impact on the Platform.
4.3. Dependence of Platform on Various Factors. The development of the Platform may be
abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of
funding, lack of commercial success or prospects, or departure of key personnel.
4.4. Lack of Interest to the Platform. Even if the Platform is finished and adopted and
launched, the ongoing success of the Platform relies on the interest and participation of
third parties like developers. There can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be
sufficient interest or participation in the Platform.
4.5. Changes to the Platform. The Platform is still under development and may undergo
significant changes over time. Although Company Parties intend for the Platform to have
the features and specifications set forth in this White Paper, changes to such features
and specifications can be made for any number of reasons, any of which may mean that
the Platform does not meet expectations of Buyer of the Tokens.
4.6. Risk associated with Other Applications. The Platform may give rise to other,
alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which the Token will
have no intrinsic value.
4.7. Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Cryptocurrency Value. The proceeds of the sale
of the Tokens will be denominated in cryptocurrency, and may be converted into other
cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of cryptocurrencies fluctuates unfavorably
during or after the Token Presale or the Token Sale, Company Parties may not be able to
fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the Platform in the manner
intended.

5. RISKS ARISING IN COURSE OF COMPANY PARTIES' BUSINESS
5.1. Risk of Conflicts of Interest. Any Company Party may be engaged in transactions with
related parties, including a respective majority shareholder, companies controlled by
him/her or in which s/he owns an interest, and other affiliates, and may continue to do
so in the future. Conflicts of interest may arise between any Company Party affiliates and
respective Company Party, potentially resulting in the conclusion of transactions on
terms not determined by market forces.
5.2. Risks Related to Invalidation of Company Parties’ Transactions. Company Parties have
taken a variety of actions relating to its business that, if successfully challenged for not
complying with applicable legal requirements, could be invalidated or could result in the
imposition of liabilities on respective Company Party. Since applicable legislation may
subject to many different interpretations, respective Company Party may not be able to
64

successfully defend any challenge brought against such transactions, and the
invalidation of any such transactions or imposition of any such liability may, individually
or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Platform.
5.3. Risk Arising from Emerging Markets. Company Parties or some of them may operate in
emerging markets. Emerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed
markets, including significant legal, economic and political risks. Emerging markets are
subject to greater risk than more developed markets, including in some cases significant
legal, economic and political risks. Emerging economies are subject to rapid change and
the information set out in this White Paper may become outdated relatively quickly.

6. GOVERNMENTAL RISKS
6.1. Uncertain Regulatory Framework. The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital
assets, and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is
difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such
technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental
authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect
cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such
changes could negatively impact the Tokens in various ways, including, for example,
through a determination that the tokens are regulated financial instruments that require
registration. Company may cease the distribution of the tokens, the development of the
Platform or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions
make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.
6.2. Failure to Obtain, Maintain or Renew Licenses and Permits. Although as of the date of
starting of the Token Presale there are no statutory requirements obliging Company of
the Tokens to receive any licenses and permits necessary for carrying out its activity,
there is the risk that such statutory requirements may be adopted in the future and may
relate to any of Company Parties. In this case, Company Parties' business will depend on
the continuing validity of such licenses and permits and its compliance with their terms.
Regulatory authorities will exercise considerable discretion in the timing of license
issuance and renewal and the monitoring of licensees’ compliance with license terms.
Requirements which may be imposed by these authorities and which may require any
Company Party to comply with numerous standards, recruit qualified personnel, maintain
necessary technical equipment and quality control systems, monitor our operations,
maintain appropriate filings and, upon request, submit appropriate information to the
licensing authorities, may be costly and time-consuming and may result in delays in the
commencement or continuation of operation of the Platform. Further, private individuals
and the public at large possess rights to comment on and otherwise engage in the
licensing process, including through intervention in courts and political pressure.
Accordingly, the licenses any Company Party may need may not be issued or renewed, or
if issued or renewed, may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion, or may involve
requirements which restrict any Company Party's ability to conduct its operations or to
do so profitably.
65

6.3. Risk of Government Action. The industry in which Company Parties operate is new, and
may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or
enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not
examine the operations of Company Parties and/or pursue enforcement actions against
them. All of this may subject Company Parties to judgments, settlements, fines or
penalties, or cause Company Parties to restructure their operations and activities or to
cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Company Parties'
reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may, in turn, have a material
adverse effect on the Tokens and/or the development of the Platform.
6.4. Risk of Burdensomeness of Applicable Laws, Regulations, and Standards. Failure to
comply with existing laws and regulations or the findings of government inspections or
increased governmental regulation of Company Parties’ operations could result in
substantial additional compliance costs or various sanctions, which could materially
adversely affect Company Parties’ business and the Platform. Company Parties’
operations and properties are subject to regulation by various government entities and
agencies, in connection with ongoing compliance with existing laws, regulations and
standards. Regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in matters of
enforcement and interpretation of applicable laws, regulations and standards.
Respective authorities have the right to, and frequently do, conduct periodic inspections
of any Company Party's operations and properties throughout the year. Any such future
inspections may conclude that any Company Party has violated laws, decrees or
regulations, and it may be unable to refute such conclusions or remedy the violations.
Any Company Party's failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or the findings
of government inspections may result in the imposition of fines or penalties or more
severe sanctions, or in requirements that respective Company Party cease certain of its
business activities, or in criminal and administrative penalties applicable to respective
officers. Any such decisions, requirements or sanctions, or any increase in governmental
regulation of our operations, could increase Company Parties’ costs and materially
adversely affect Company Parties’ business and the Platform.
6.5. Unlawful or Arbitrary Government Action. Governmental authorities may have a high
degree of discretion and, at times, act selectively or arbitrarily, without hearing or prior
notice, and sometimes in a manner that is contrary to law or influenced by political or
commercial considerations. Moreover, the government also has the power in certain
circumstances, by regulation or government act, to interfere with the performance of,
nullify or terminate contracts. Unlawful, selective or arbitrary governmental actions have
reportedly included the denial or withdrawal of licenses, sudden and unexpected tax
audits, criminal prosecutions and civil actions. Federal and local government entities
have also used common defects in matters surrounding the Token Sale as pretexts for
court claims and other demands to invalidate or to void any related transaction, often for
political purposes. In this environment, Company Parties’ competitors may receive
preferential treatment from the government, potentially giving them a competitive
advantage over Company Parties.
