1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Worldwide, the total consumption of electricity reached almost 20.000 TWh1 with an average
price of 0.14 USD per KWh, which equates to USD 3tn per year! Commercial buildings account
for 40-50 % of this amount. Besides the growing consumption, the key issue in the power
industry is the unpredictability of supply and demand of electricity, such as the influx of
renewable sources, e.g. solar panels and wind turbines. They are not producing electricity
when there is no sun/wind and they cause an excess in the grid when the weather conditions
are favourable. On the other hand, there are more and more electric vehicles charging which is
very unpredictable. Both issues make the electricity grid extremely unstable, which causes high
costs of the system’s operators and also high costs for the end-user. These situations require
substantial investments in new infrastructure and smarter use of the existing one. In order to
sustain our actual standard of living, we must reduce (per capita) and shift (in time) the
consumption of electrical energy.
This is exactly what Robotina, with its 28 years’ experience, delivers to households and
businesses. With the Robotina Platform, the future is HERE. We have tested, demonstrated
and validated, that we can save 10-20 % by using state-of-the-art technology, which is available
and feasible NOW2. In our vision, our community members collaborate in order to save and
earn money while consuming electrical energy. This vision becomes reality with the deployment
of the Robotina Platform.
The Robotina Platform will be a vertical, high-tech all-inclusive enabling solution, consisting of
connected Internet of Things (IoT) elements (things, processes, data, people) and the Power
Platform (PP). It will use Smart Rules, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies. It will
be run in the cloud, available as a service. Robotina Platform and connected IoT will execute
thousands of calculations per second. Each calculation will result in a small benefit and a small
slice of revenue, which will accumulate every second. At the end of the day, this will become
the driving force of the business. Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, patented multiobjective optimization and blockchain technology allows us to disrupt the electricity
market and implement a collaborative sharing economy business model, which
distributes numerous benefits to the participating users.
We will ‘empower people’ to become our partners in revolutionizing the traditional power
network. It is about a new paradigm of designing and operating the electrical power system
with the objective to improve its efficiency, to enhance user engagement, increase service quality,
and save costs in power generation, distribution, and consumption. Constant negotiations
between the community members with aggregated data and the smart grid will enable us to
create a state-of-the art disruptive business model.

The creation of a connected community, whose members will gain substantial savings
on energy costs, generate significant revenues as well as contribute to a greener
environment and sustainable development by optimizing energy consumption and
consequently reducing emissions, had now begun. Even more, the community will be
a part of a new social media, which will connect people, processes, things, and data from
homes, businesses and other institutions’ buildings. They will share real-time data, messages,
achievements and footprints. Businesses will have access to qualified information and users’
needs, which will convert into benefits for all participants.
Direct, native benefits for each connected user (community member) will be as follows:
•• AWARENESS & CONTROLL: Energy Management System (EMS), HIQ-Home and other IoT will be
connected to the Robotina Platform, so that users will be able to monitor their sites/entities and
IoT and control them at anytime from anywhere.
•• SAVINGS (ENERGY EFFICIENCY & DYNAMIC ENERGY PRICING): Analytical tools, remote control,
advanced rules, multi-objective optimization and Artificial Intelligence will help users to achieve
fast ROI (Return on Investment) saving more than 20 % on their energy expenses. By investing
in energy efficiency, users will reduce CO2 emissions and enjoy tax benefits.
•• SECURITY & SAFETY: Artificial Intelligence will detect unusual and dangerous situations and
send notifications to the user.
•• COMMUNITY BOOK: Users and their sites/entities will cooperate by reporting their real time
data, sending notifications and forming social networks and thus participating in the sharing
economy business model.
Additional benefits for participating users will be based on the collaborative sharing
economy business model, and will be derived from:
•• POWER SELLING: Community members will use smart grids to earn money based on their
activities, namely by providing on- request variable consumption to energy suppliers and grid
operators. Earned revenue will be distributed among the eligible participating users, based on
and in correlation with their activities.
•• CROWD BUYING: The platform will enable users to form and participate in the crowd buying
initiatives in order to negotiate significant discounts on energy prices.
•• MARKETPLACE ACTIVITIES: Users will participate in smart-contract based businesses. They will
be able to sell or buy various services, available to the connected users and 3rd parties.
•• INTERNAL TRADE: Those who produce energy will be able to sell it to other users, thus eliminating
the need for middleman and unnecessary costs.
•• DATA SALES: Community will sell anonymous data to the grid stakeholders and remunerate
participating users.
•• ENERGY SERVICE COMPANY (ESCO) & VIRTUAL POWER PLANT (VPP) CROWD FUNDING: Users
will be able to use Robotina Utility Tokens (ROX) in order to participate in crowd funding of the
profitable projects using ESCO or VPP schemes.
Benefits for big and corporate users:
•• ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND FAULT PREDICITION: Large consumers and corporate users will
connect their buildings to the Robotina Platform and subscribe to its services. Our Cognitive
Optimization System will help them reducing their energy and maintenance expenses by
an estimated 30 %.
As seen above, community members will enjoy a dramatic reduction in their overall energy
costs. They will gain control and boost their safety and security. Finally, they will earn and

6

contribute to their community’s benefits as well as increase their responsibility towards
nature and future generations. In order to provide transparency, traceability and safety of the
entire network and community, we are implementing an additional feature, the Robotina Utility
Token (ROX). The token will let members acquire things and services in a virtual marketplace at
a 3 % discount rate and will enable them to receive additional benefits in correlation with their
collective activities. User benefits will be the driving force, influencing exponential growth
in a number of connected users. More users will cause more transactions and accelerate
the wider adoption of the Robotina Utility Token (ROX).
The Robotina Platform will be crypto-friendly and Robotina Utility token (ROX) will be the exclusive
token, used in all internal transactions. The user will receive a special discount when paying with
ROX (one of the ROX utility features), whereas the services and products sold on the Robotina
platform could also be acquired with other cryptocurrencies, tokens or fiat money. Any other
means of payment will be converted into ROX tokens and intended for the funding of the benefits
earned by community.
A public Initial Coin Offering (ICO) will take place in March 2018 in order to collect contributions
($28.5mio - Hard Cap) from supporters and to award them with ROX tokens. All 815.000.000 ROX
tokens sold will be generated after the ICO (1st May 2018). Later issuances will be disabled in
the smart contract for ever. In summary, the deregulation of the electrical supply industry and
the related legal framework enabled the separation of roles of electric industry stakeholders,
removes monopolies and opens the market place. Most states have committed to reduce CO2
emissions by increasing renewables in their portfolio by 2020 and to use a smart grid concept.
New technologies and connected devices are widely accepted and new, platform based business3,
are overtaking the traditional ones.
For the first time in the history, opportunity, technology, as well as legal and social conditions
are favourable and ready for the Robotina Platform to step onto the stage. Internet of Things,
Blockchain Technology (enabling smart contracts) and Artificial intelligence bring great
benefits to users and investors. Connected to the Robotina Platform, an enabling Universe,
empowered people will save the electricity by using smart grids in order to save and earn
money and reduce the pollution of our planet. We won’t do more, we will just do it smarter!
We “empower the people” to become part in revolutionizing the traditional power network systems.
It is a new paradigm of designing and operating the electrical power network with the objective to
improve efficiency, enhance user engagement, increase service quality, and save costs in power
generation, distribution, and consumption. Constant negotiations between the community with
aggregated data and the smart grids, enables us to create a disruptive business model.
In Robotina we envisioned this future based on existing products and solutions which Robotina has
developed in the last 28 years. To take the opportunity of this moment we have the technology
(IoT, blockchain, AI), the necessary conditions as sale and distribution of energy is deregulated,
and finally, the consumers are keen to join a collaborative consumption model where they see
benefits. By upgrading our solutions and connecting all participants with the platform, we will create
communities, which will be beneficial for everyone.
We are incorporating the ROX Utility Token to provide transparency, traceability and safety of the
entire network and community. The token will enable members to acquire things and services in a
virtual marketplace with 3 % discount, whereas the blockchain technology also enables us to reward
their individual and collective activities with ROX tokens (in correlation with their active participation).

2.5 ROBOTINA’S COMMERCIAL SMART ENERGY PROJECTS
This section describes the three most relevant commercial smart energy projects in which we have
successfully delivered in highly competitive international environment. As always, we used our
proprietary control & cloud technology and our advanced Cognitive Optimization System5 (COS) as
the enabling technologies.
2.5.1 SPEYER, Germany (2015-2018)
Hitachi from Japan and City of Speyer, Germany, jointly developed a smart community project with
support from NEDO, Japanese agency for new technology deployment. Robotina designed and
implemented a control system, machine learning and cloud software. The project consists of PV
(Solar) power plant, battery storage, complex Energy Management System (EMS), consumption
prediction, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The system has the choice of multiple
energy sources (PV, grid, district heating). It uses Artificial Intelligence to predict energy
consumption of each apartment; it aggregates it and selects the best strategy to minimize energy
cost. As a result, the energy costs are automatically and continuously optimized. Users enjoy the
lowest possible expenses and still retain full comfort.

2.5.2 NEDO SMART GRID PROJECT, Slovenia (2017-2018)
This is a smart grid demonstration project, where a the next day’s electrical consumption is
forecasted for specific grid segments. In case of grid limitations, a critical peak tariff is activated for
certain periods of time, thus motivating consumers to reduce their consumption. Robotina delivers
integrated Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) for residential owners, which synchronize
with critical peak information and automatically lower the consumption to the minimum acceptable
for the required comfort and safety. The house owner takes advantage of being able to adopt a
dynamic tariff, not sacrificing his/her comfort at the same time.

2.5.3 ENERGIE GRAZ, Austria (2018)
New energy regulations in Austria (2018) promote installation of renewable energy sources in
multi-apartment buildings. A company can invest into rooftop photovoltaic plant and a battery
storage system and attract apartment owners to use green energy. Based on its standard
HEMS product, Robotina developed a dedicated solution to enable the provider with accurate
real time information on energy usage and the division between different energy sources (PV,
battery, grid) in time. This new model of energy supply will enable a more ambitious shift into
renewable energy sources.
2.5.4 ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS, Germany, Austria,
Switzerland, South Africa (2016 and ongoing)
Our eSTORE, energy storage and management
system, helps thousands of users to reduce their
energy expenses and increase autonomy. Owners
of the Photovoltaic Plants (PV) generate their own
energy, but often they are not able to consume it,
so they have no other option than to sell it to the
Utility Company. Payment for such energy is minimal,
several times lower than the energy price, when the
same user is forced to buy it from the same utility
company. With our smart energy storage and HEMS,
users can store their green energy in an eSTORE and
use it when needed. In addition, HEMS controls their
energy flow and optimizes it. Users enjoy savings and
can control their energy flow.

3. INDUSTRY INSIGHT
AND THE OPPORTUNITY
Our society is in the phase of digital transformation, a process, which is changing it as deeply and
widely as never before. Energy chain and electrical grids are not an exemption, even more - they
are the driving force of changes.
Dramatic changes in our energy “picture” happened over previous years and will strongly continue
in the next decade. Introduction of renewable energy resources, like usage of solar, wind and other
green technologies and the reduction of traditional “dirty” sources like coal or nuclear, contributes
to higher and less predictable fluctuations in overall energy production. Utility companies and grid
operators, which must keep the grid stable by matching the consumption and generation at any
time, encounter technical and financial challenges to execute this essential task.The coming of
mass introduction of electrical vehicles, which need fast recharging, will further destabilize the
grid and increase the cost to meet this growing demand.
To summarize, pain is the most important generator of changes and actually, the pain is already
severe because of:
•
•
•
•
•

Growth of energy consumption;
Continuous increase of energy costs;
Increased costs for grid stabilization due to usage of renewable energy;
High costs and time to implement new infrastructures;
Need to preserve the natural environment.

To sustain our actual standards of living, we must reduce (per capita) and shift (in time) the
consumption of electrical energy.
The task is challenging and until recently, the only way to keep the grid stable, was using expensive
energy sources (gas fired power plants) when extra power was needed, and to virtually burn the
energy, in case generation happened to be higher than consumption. Now, for the first time in the
history, huge optimization is possible, without wasting precious resources, because the two critical
conditions: (1) legal and social acceptance and (2) technology are ready and available.

3.1 LEGAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS
Legal and social conditions are among the most critical. Facing digitalization, our society has to
pass through several phases. We had to accept that computers became very important. We have
let them care about our communications, security, safety, wellbeing and more. We carry connected
devices with us and share important personal data over social networks and the internet. Digital
technology is transforming every part of our society and it is widely accepted as a fact.

17

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

The outlook of the most important legal and social factors, which are in place:
•
•
•
•
•

Deregulation in the electrical supply chain enabled separation of roles, removed monopolies
and opened the market;
Legal framework forced deregulation and created an organized, structured and democratic
energy market;
Commitment by most countries to reduce CO2 emissions and to reach significant proportion of
renewables in their energy portfolio;
Wider acceptance of connected devices, including smartphones and IoT;
Digital transformation in all parts of society.

Society accepts and understands important and dramatic changes and so does business. New,
previously impossible business models have conquered the world6. Sharing and collaborative
economic business models, which use platforms, are the most successful.

3.2 TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPEMENT
Finally, technology is the enabling condition and occupies the central role in these new business
models. The following technologies are necessary to achieve the digital transformation and to
realize our project:
•
•
•
•
•

Internet Of Things (IoT);
Blockchain and Smart Contracts;
Artificial Intelligence;
Efficient battery storage;
Cloud computing and big data.

In future, business will need to rely on the above-mentioned technologies to be successful.
3.2.1 INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT)
The IoT movement represents a true digital transformation which includes the connection of
things, which communicate via internet, people, processes and data throughout the value
chain. IoT comprises of four key elements including all sorts of connections imaginable:
-

-

-

People: Considered as end-nodes connected across the Internet to form communities,
collaborate in consumption and share information. Examples include social networks, health
and fitness sensors, applications, collaborative activities and games;
Things: Physical sensors, devices, actuators and other items generating data or receiving
information from other sources. Examples include smart thermostats and gadgets;
Data: Raw data analysed and processed into meaningful information to enable intelligent
decisions and control mechanisms. Examples include temperature logs converted into an
average number of high-temperature hours per day to evaluate room cooling requirements;
Processes: Leveraging connectivity among data, things and people to add value. Examples
include the use of smart fitness devices and social networks to advertise relevant healthcare
offerings to prospective customers.

All four building blocks are connected locally or through the Internet. People and things have the
ability to sense, decide and act. Processes ultimately follow specific targets and deliver results.
The most advanced technology supports the IoT.
IoT plays a central role in our project. IoT senses and controls our assets with local
intelligence. They are connected to the cloud based services, which process the information
and optimize processes to best meet the user’s needs and requirements.

3.2.2 BLOCKCHAIN AND SMART CONTRACTS
Ethereum is “turing complete”, meaning it is completely functional and can perform any computation
that you can do in other programming languages. Therefore it is one of the most exciting technologies
in the blockchain space. This is the main reason for the Robotina development team, to select it and
work on integration of the Ethereum client, which will be used to:
•
•
•

Connect to the Ethereum network;
Create new transactions and smart contracts;
Run smart contracts.

The first smart contract deployed will manage the subscriptions7. The Robotina team and users will
add further smart contracts, which will govern all the transactions.
Robotina’s token is called Robotina Utility Token (ROX). It is an application specific token,
built on top of the existing Ethereum blockchain. We integrated the whole life cycle of
the Robotina Utility Token (ROX) inside the blockchain environment. Marketplace
transactions and all the native platform benefits will evolve with time and become
completely smart contract based.
3.2.3 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Artificial Intelligence (AI) with machine learning and cognitive optimization is perhaps the
most disruptive technology ever. Its fast development, wide availability and usability effects
every process in all our activities. Development of the AI during the last few years and in 2017
particularly, has been spectacular. AI came all the way from demonstration projects in which
computers won against humans8, to delivery of practical benefits in the areas of medicine,
industry, environmental technologies, space, energy and many others. Development and usage
of AI is growing exponentially.
In our project, we use the AI and machine learning to build and constantly improve
models, which allow us to predict consumption and we use cognitive optimization to
achieve optimal results.

3.2.4 BATTERY STORAGE
Developments of efficient battery storage and incredible progress in the durability of the new,
modern batteries, together with cost reduction, have reached the point, when batteries became
a feasible solution for temporally energy storage. Big, utility scale, storage systems9 are deployed
by utility companies. Households and electric vehicles (EVs) use smaller batteries, but with high
numbers10 they represent an important shift in the market.
Batteries are an ideal PROSUMER11. They can store energy, when available and they can
release it when needed.

3.3 SMART GRIDS
Now that Europe together with most of the industrialized world, have come very far in deregulation
of the electrical utility grids and energy markets, with others countries following at a fast pace,
“smart grid” became the most important component of our energy policy, which is essential for
reliable and cost effective supply.
Smart grid is an electrical grid which allows connection of smart meters, smart consuming devices,
communication and optimization. It is one of the strongest driving forces for designing the IoT
communications and control systems. It is a new paradigm of designing and operating the electrical
power system with the objective to improve efficiency, enhance service quality, and to save cost
in power generation, distribution, and consumption. Each smart grid system has three major
components, with different functionalities:

Power generation - It is composed

3.3.1 KEEPING THE GRID STABLE – CLASSIC APPROACH
As already explained, the smart grid is a big system of interconnected generators and consumers,
who are relatively independent, but connected to the same distribution grid. Generators and
consumers often have conflicting interests - generators want to deliver stable output at the
highest possible prices, while consumers want to be free in changing consumption and want
the lowest cost.
The power distribution, which includes energy transportation and energy vendors, has to keep
the grid stable by keeping generation and consumption balanced at all times. They use various
methods to reach the target. How do they do this influences their costs, service quality and
profitability.
Information and communication technologies are adopted into the smart grid in order to
achieve balanced energy generation, distribution and consumption in a network. Energy
Management System (EMS) measures the power consumption and data that is transferred
from smart meters to the control centre for processing and storage. Information is used to
optimize the electrical power generation.
Given the estimated aggregated power demand (estimated demand) of consumers in a serviced
area, it is in the core interest of energy vendor to buy the amount of energy (power) so, that it
best matches the estimated demand. This will guarantee lowest costs and best margins.
If estimated demand is higher than actual demand, the supplied power is wasted (i.e., oversupply).
On the other hand, if actual demand is higher than the estimated demand, additional power
supply is required (i.e., undersupply) where the power generator charges a higher price than
the price in a upfront periodic contract due to the instantaneous need.
The core interest of an energy vendor is to buy energy at the lowest possible cost and to
sell it with the highest possible margin. This is only possible, if vendor optimizes the match
between estimated demand and actual demand. Deviations from this have a dramatic
impact on their energy costs.
3.3.2 PROFIT MAXIMIZATION – CLASSIC APPROACH
Energy vendors have developed several methods to maximize their profits. In essence, they try to
pass on the pain to consumers.
Dynamic information exchange between vendors and consumers, does not exist. Classic tariff
models are fixed. Such classic tariff models are based on historically observed usage patterns
and are often delivered as an on-peak and off-peak tariff with fixed timings. Further tariff models
in this group include ”power profile tariff”, when consumer subscribes to a certain usage profile
and then pays extra for any deviations.

21

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

One-way solutions with utility companies being able to remotely disconnect consumer’s
appliances, are being used in some areas12. They have limited effect and can significantly impact
on a consumer’s comfort; therefore, vendors must offer significant incentives for consumers
to accept this model. In addition, without smart meters, vendors are not able to forecast the
benefits of such remote actions.
Smart meters may solve a part of the problem. They are able to communicate in near-real time and
they can provide a two-way communication, but their functionality is limited and it is not IoT based.
The main benefit for consumers is that a smart meter can deliver cost information, so consumers
can adapt their consumption to minimize their expenses.
Classic tariff models are unable to optimize the energy expenses through the value
chain – from generator to the final consumer. Therefore the suppliers and consumers
need to explore new, real time solutions, which communicate in real time.

3.3.3 PROFIT MAXIMIZATION – MODERN APPROACH
Given the fact that energy vendors and consumers have conflicting interest and that dynamic
communication and organized market does not exist, they have each developed their own ways
.to optimize their interests
Vendors invented complex purchase systems supported by software and rather primitive EMS13
systems. They have invented ways to temporally store energy and deliver it when needed. They
are adding various solutions but with limited success.
Consumers, on their side, try to adapt their consumption to best suit their selected tariff system.
They use devices of different complexity to move the bulk of their consumption to the off-peak
period. Smart grid regulations have given them a powerful tool – they can switch between
suppliers easily and frequently.
Consumers and consumer organizations have started to organize themselves. They are forming
permanent or temporally “cooperatives” and join forces in their negotiations with suppliers.
This can help them to reduce their energy costs, but not to improve the tariff system.
Sometimes consumers are able to form so called “Virtual Power Plant” (VPP), which can
temporally react to the supplier’s request for changes in the momentary power consumption.
Two groups with conflicting interests found ways to optimize them separately. Results
are visible, but could become more important if consumers were able to automatically
and dynamically change their power (energy consumption) in constant negotiation with
their suppliers.

3.4 SMART GRIDS – OPPORTUNITY
Vendor’s core interest is to generate profit from energy sales and to minimize expenses for grid
stability. As already described, vendors must, to be profitable, buy energy with periodic contracts,
which guarantee them the best possible price. If they have to buy the missing energy or dispose
the excessive energy, this can affect their business significantly.
Unfortunately, for them, it is not easy to forecast energy consumption. Users do not ask them
when to switch on or off their appliances. They simply do it.
To make things worse, solar and wind power plants inject energy into the utility grid, when the
sun is shining and wind blowing. Similarly, electric vehicles will request charging when drivers
connect them and this will often happen simultaneously.
In such conditions, supplier’s EMS is close to useless. Advancing algorithms and using Artificial
Intelligence, could improve it, but not to the level to justify the investment.
Investment in the infrastructure needed to meet the increasing demand will be enormous and
probably not sustainable; therefore, the only solution is not to do more, but to do it smarter.
Fortunately, the enabling conditions are finally here14.
To achieve their targets in the form of profit and grid stability, energy vendors should
establish a constant dialogue/negotiation with consumers or consumer’s community to
constantly optimize the match between estimated demand and actual demand. This will
reduce their costs and they will share part of this reduction with consumers.

4. THE SOLUTION: IoT + AI + Blockchain
Robotina developed and continues to develop a combination of platform and connected
things, which maximizes benefits for users by smartly using power and energy trading in “smart
grids”. To do so, AI patented based multi-objective optimization is the best strategy. Users’
direct benefit is reduced energy cost, improved control over their assets, and finally, improved
comfort, safety and security.
Things and users connect to the Robotina Platform, which not only provides its services in real time,
and with real time/real world data from IoT, but also uses them to provide real, measurable benefits
to users and to the community. This brings people, things and businesses together and it offers a
unique virtual community with structure, which facilitates various collaborative business models.
By doing this, the Robotina Platform provides an attractive marketplace, where businesses can
access millions of connected things and users to offer various services regulated by smart contracts.
The platform collects commissions from transactions on behalf of the community. Funds are used
to improve the platform. Members’ benefits are explained later in this document.
The aggregated impact of users on the electricity grid is enormous and it is a source of huge power,
which will be used for continuous real time negotiations with all participants on “smart grids”. This
will generate important revenue and this collective power will finally work for the members’ benefits.
So, for the first time in the history, the platform truly will “EMPOWER THE PEOPLE”.

4.1. HARDWARE COMPONENTS – CONNECTED THINGS
IoT things have the ability to influence energy consumption or production and communicate with
the Robotina Platform. They are intelligent and execute their primary function, but when allowed,
they also cooperate with the platform, become PROSUMERS and generate benefits for their owners
and for the community.
We have developed and started marketing the following IoT things which are used in homes,

All products are built by Cybrotech Ltd.15 Utilising native IoT control technology and open,
documented communication protocols, so other hardware manufacturers have the opportunity
to build products, which connect to the platform too. Our IoT can be remotely programmed in an
automatic, easy and safe way, which is a unique and necessary enabling technology.
To facilitate development of IoT things to other hardware manufacturers, our hardware components
and system software are available to them together with the support of the Robotina team.

4.2 ROBOTINA CORE - CLOUD APPLICATION
The Robotina Platform runs in the cloud and it is available as SaaS (Software as a Service). The
Robotina Core (“The Core”), has been developed, tested and implemented for data exchange,
implementation of AI and supporting algorithms, data processing and storage along with real time
processes. The Core has several functionalities:

-

Collecting and aggregating live-stream data, sent from IoT, that contains measurements and
statuses of all connected smart devices in installation sets;
− Producing data analytics and visualizations of data, presented on web and mobile applications,
that provide users with an insight into their profile;
Running AI algorithms understand data patterns and modelling of the behaviour of whole
community and individual user;
Triggers alarms and alerts, predefined and set by the user;
Suggesting pre-prepared programs which offers a reduction of energy usage, based on user’s
profile and habits;
Supporting data mining and execution of marketing campaigns;

-

Executing transactions and interacting with blockchain.

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

The Core is scalable and able to support several millions connected installations with the possibility
to install it in parallel on several instances.
With the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) funds we plan to upgrade “The Core” and enable the platform’s
infrastructure, services and applications to be extended by developing and improving the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

distributed data collection and sensing, where sensory information can be
detected and collected from everywhere;
global data and resource sharing, where sensory information and resources
can be shared globally;
remote and real-time data access, where recorded data can be accessed
and analysed in real time from anywhere;
elastic resource provisioning and scaling, where service users can provision
and scale up and down their needed resources based on demand;
pay-as-you-go pricing, where cloud users can request, release, and pay for
resources whenever needed;
upgrade the AI and machine learning;
integrate blockchain based smart contracts;
Robotina Utility Token (ROX) transaction system;
Integrate intelligent brokers;
Marketplace open business environment for third party business models;
Embedded crowd funding platform;
Advanced marketing modules.

The Core has four vertical layers
• Aggregates: Virtual structures, which aggregate (combine) some of the key parameters.
They are interest driven and the same entity or thing can contribute their parameters to
several aggregators at the same time. Our power-selling portfolio is a typical aggregate.
• Structures: Combinations of entities owned or managed by a single user regardless of their
geographical location (portfolio, compound and similar).
• Site/Entity: Things at the same location (site), which represent an entity like home, building,
school, etc.
• Things: IoT things are devices connected to the platform through the Internet described in
section 4.1

4.3 COS – COGNITIVE OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM
Cognitive Optimization System (COS) is “the brains” of the platform. It uses sets of rules, which
constantly optimize operation of IoT things with the target to implement a user’s strategy and
maximize his/her benefits. Robotina patented multi-objective optimization dynamically finds the
best compromise between various objectives. Once optimized parameters are calculated, they are
transferred to IoT in a form of set points or new, optimized application software.
COS has the ability to improve itself. It uses machine learning to constantly improve models,
algorithms and rules.

26

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

When external conditions, like a tariff system changes, COS and the platform expertly compile a
new strategy, test it on the model and send it to the IoT things, which are immediately updated with
the new situation and with the new strategy implemented.

27

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

4.4 WEB AND MOBILE APPLICATION – USER INTERFACE
The web and mobile user interface applications (“The Commander”) enable the user to monitor and
control his hardware (IoT) in real time and to interact with the platform.
The Commander will empower the user to:
•
•
•
•
•

Know and control the details of his site (home) power requirements and energy consumption;
Know actual energy costs and take informed decisions;
Control all connected devices from anywhere in the world;
Receive instant notifications and alarms;
See and check his home remotely.

The Commander’s main function is to help user reducing his energy expenses. In addition it enables
remote and automatic control of IoT things for convenience and safety/security purposes.
4.4.1 MONITORING AND CONTROL
Monitoring of energy flow and status of all IoT things is already available. We are continuously
upgrading this functionality. It’s main functions are:
-

Smart device data: a) Which devices are on and off; b) How much energy is each one using now
and in the past;
Turning smart devices on and off remotely;
Insights - System sends notifications of trends and negative patterns (those that may not be
noticed without data analytics) to the user;
Balance - a) How many ROX Tokens are on user’s account; b) The history of actions and purchases;
Alerts and warnings - Which are the events that are a potential deviation from normal
patterns, which are the negative patterns of energy usage. The back office also emphasises
the security and safety of living. The system enables automation of alarms and warnings,
relieving individual’s day-to-day life of potential troubles. While away from home, the user will
be able to monitor his/her devices, to see how balanced they are or even check the log for
excessive energy consumption. The system generates a notification alarm and sends it to the
user via SMS, e-mail or application.

4.4.2 MANAGEMENT
Account management tools empower members to execute various tasks, including:
-

Robotina Utility Token (ROX) monitoring and transactions;
Managing user’s account, profiles and allowing others to join;
Organizing IoT things, sites and aggregates;
Configuring and customizing all services;
Managing COMMUNITY BOOK, publishing footprints and messages;
Using and customizing the platform’s services and access to benefits;
Joining groups and cooperatives;

28

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

- Participating and doing business in the marketplace;
- Interacting with the smart contracts;
- Setting up conditional rules for smart device operation;
- Managing the internal energy flow from solar panels (and other generators) internally or in batteries;
- Selecting strategies;
- Setting social activities, including donations, charity, resource sharing.
In short, this set of tools allows the users to manage and configure their platform.

4.5 PLATFORM GENERATED USERS’ BENEFITS, SAVINGS AND REVENUE
The Robotina platform’s main task is to provide benefits to its users. The platform’s native users’
benefit modules help users to understand their energy profile, control their IoT things and save or
earn ROX tokens (money) and contribute to the preservation of the natural environment. They are
the main motivator for users to join the platform.
4.5.1 USER’S NATIVE BENEFITS
1. Awareness – This is the basic functionality, which will help users to understand their energy
profile, consumption and production. Tariff systems and offers of various providers will be
analysed and compared. Potential changes could be simulated with real data thus leading to
savings that will be achieved through better information and consequent decisions. User will be
able to set various alarms and notifications.
2. Control – User will act. By using his “Commander” application, user will access, monitor and
control his things and sites through smartphone or web browser regardless of his location. He
will be able to instantly change the ON/OFF status. Alternatively, he will be able to impose new
rules, make other change or can set the scheduled tasks.
3. Energy saving – Behaviour analyses, machine learning, energy efficiency (EE) rules, weather
forecast and the power of the platform will be used to achieve one task: to implement user’s
strategy and actively seek for best compromise between energy consumption, comfort and
other objectives.
4. Smart grids – The ultimate PROSUMER functionality. User will benefit from dynamic energy
pricing and use his IoT things and the Robotina platform to dramatically reduce his energy
expenses without sacrifising his comfort. Some users’ assets – IoT things, solar power plant,
battery storage and even electrical vehicle - are real prosumers (they can actually produce
energy). Other assets are virtual prosumers – Home Energy Management System (HEMS) and
the Robotina platform will turn them into prosumers by wisely shifting their usage in time.
4.5.2 USER’S BENEFITS BASED ON COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY
5. POWER TRADING – User who will join the community cooperative initiative will be rewarded
with ROX tokens (and money) by offering their assets to the platform initiative of POWER
TRADING. The platform will aggregate users and form an enormous Virtual Power Plant, which
will sell its services to various players on the grid.

29

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

6. INTERNAL ENERGY TRADE – The Robotina Platform will enable members of the community to
sell or buy energy from other community members.
7. COMMUNITY (CROWD) ENERGY PURCHASING & SALE – Aggregated needs will gain bargaining
power. Joint forces will enable community members to negotiate better prices and better
conditions for additional savings.
8. DATA SALES – Platform will collect various anonymous data, which may be shared with the
companies requiring it, as determined with the Platform Privacy Policy. The users sharing certain
data will be rewarded with ROX tokens.
9. COMMUNITY BOOK – Users will publish real time data and publish their achievements, allow
tailor made messages and declare their requirements. This will create a virtual, connected
community with multiple benefits for users.
4.5.3 OTHER USER’S BENEFITS
10. ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM – Users can benefit from all businesses in the marketplace and
they can actively set their cooperative, business or charity initiatives on the platform.
11. POWER – Community means power and power means savings and safety.
12. OPPORTUNITY – Users will be able to participate on the marketplace by selling or buying
various services.

4.6 BLOCKCHAIN AND ROBOTINA UTILITY TOKEN (ROX)
The Robotina’s project includes integration of advanced blockchain technology. We will establish
a Robotina an Utility Token (ROX), a digital cryptocurrency, that when used, will give a 3 %
discount for all transactions with and within the Robotina platform. ROX aims to become the
main cryptocurrency in the “Smart Grid” world.
This technology is absolutely necessary to create and manage the community which will be
global and will form sub-communities which may be geography-driven (Europe, a city, a street)
or interest-driven (power selling, community purchase etc.). It will enable the creation of a
transparent, secure and distributed storage of information about transactions.
The ROX Utility Token will be an ERC-20 standard compliant token will. A limited number of tokens
will be released at the Token Generation Event and they will be distributed according to the
Token Distribution Plan.
We will not only create a digital coupon or voucher, but will take advantage of the blockchain
technology to create a utility cryptocurrency with the purpose to become the global “Smart Grid”
cryptocurrency.
The ROX token will be the exclusive community cryptocurrency for all transactions within the
platform, which includes acquiring hardware and services and getting paid for contributions
like usage of IoT and assets in the power trade or other revenue generating activities on the
Robotina platform.
Smart contracts will be deployed for token generation events and subscription management
services. Each subscription paid will get locked into a smart contract for 6 months. As the
community grows, more subscriptions will be locked in the smart contract enhancing the
exclusivity of further subscriptions. The platform marketplace will also enable outside partners to
use the platform as a service, and deploy their own smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain
and reach out the community.

4.7 ROBOTINA PLATFORM MARKETPLACE
The platform will provide several benefits to the users and offer new revenue streams for the
active participation of community members. The marketplace will be the central business area
of the platform. All the transactions will take place in the marketplace. As already described the
Robotina platform offers some native (embedded) benefits, while the marketplace provides an
organized business environment, which enables users to generate and participate in different
business initiatives.
ROX tokens will be used as the platform’s cryptocurrency.All transactions on the platform will
use ROX tokens. The electronic bank transfers in fiat currencies and other cryptocurrencies
will also be accepted and automatically converted to ROX tokens using external cryptocurrency
exchanges to facilitate the processes. At the beginning of platform’s implementation the
following sectors will be supported16 on a marketplace:
-

Hardware and software e-store: IoT things will be available for purchase;
Native (embedded) benefits: Services offered by the platform, including internal
trade and external data sales;
Cooperative: Users and members will propose and join initiatives;
Business: Businesses will be able to offer smart services based on smart contracts;
Social: Initiatives to improve the community and the world.

The business cycle is as follows:
Leaflet -> subscription -> delivery of service -> payment.
Revenues for the Robotina platform will be generated in several ways17:
-

Subscription to the platform’s services;
Commission earned from business transactions on the marketplace;
Participation from the quantified benefits (for example savings);
Data (various models of selling data).

The Robotina platform’s marketplace will comprise of all sorts of connections imaginable
segmented into end-user verticals: business to business (B2B), business to consumer (B2C),
consumer to business (C2B) and consumer to consumer (C2C). Such a flexible marketplace will
generate extraordinary opportunities for organizations, individuals, communities and other entities
to gain huge value from networked connections and connected things through services, data,
processes, things and people. The platform will leverage the cognitive AI algorithms to enhance
current and develop new profitable businesses in the following way:

4.8 BROKERS
Brokers are smart programs who deal (negotiate, exchange data) with the outside world. They consist
of various rules and parameters, which are constantly improved by extensive implementation of
machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Brokers will be used for automatic online negotiations with the businesses and other players in the
Robotina platform, like, but not limited to:
-

Grid (balance group) operators;
Energy/power providers and users;
Data users;
Marketing data users (equipment and service suppliers, who need targeted data);
Customer analytics;
Consumer product manufacturers.

Brokers will be dynamically seeking the best deals for participating users. The engaged community
will earn commission from every transaction negotiated by the broker as a reward based on their
active cooperation. Brokers will be an extremely important part of the platform. We have already
developed several brokers18 and several more will be developed and implemented.

4.9 COMMUNITY BOOK
Community book is a unique interest-based social networking service with participating users,
IoT things and entities. Users can divulge data, statuses, achievements and messages from the
connected IoT things and entities. They can make it publicly accessible, or shared only amongst a
.selected group. Users can comment, send messages and express opinions
IoT things and entities, e.g. washing machine, heat pump, home, school, building, factory or others
can disclose their achievements, like reduction of energy costs or becoming self-sufficient.
Users will be able to publish their interest to buy or sell equipment and suppliers will be able to
send them offers, which will be fine-tuned for them.
Impact of actions and decisions will be expressed and viewed in real time with the real time data from
the IoT things and entities. Calculated footprints will complement and enrich the user’s experience.
The user will have full autonomy and authority to decide what and when will be published.
The community book will be the first social network, which will include people, things,
entities and businesses. With multiple transactions per second, it will allow new types of
social interactions and it will contribute to efficient social and business processes.

18 For example: a broker which constantly offers and negotiates possible changes in power consumption to the grid operator in the
GOFLEX project.

32

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

4.9.1 FOOTPRINTS AND COMMUNITY REWARDS
The Robotina platform will constantly calculate the main footprints, like carbon footprint, water
footprint and other footprints for things, sites and users. Footprints will be used as Key Performance
Indicators and will help in positive differentiation of users, IoT things and sites.
Community will then offer rewards in the form of ROX tokens to those, who will positively stand apart.

4.10 SHARING AND COLLABORATIVE ECONOMY MODEL
Our sharing and collaborative economy model enables users to gain direct benefits; join other
users to increase bargaining power when buying or selling energy or interact with businesses on
the marketplace.
In our advanced sharing and collaborative economy model, which is only possible with IoT, entities
structures and aggregates, connected users, who provide their IoT and connected assets to the
community power-selling portfolio19 will obtain ROX tokens from the system in exchange for the
services that their assets contributed to the community.
Active participation in the sharing and collaborative economy model will reward community with
ROX tokens in correlation with their active participation. This will allow users to be on both sides,
in which they will be enabled to act as both providers and receivers of tokens from the system.
4.10.1 ENERGY SERVICE COMPANY (ESCO) CROWDFUNDING
The Robotina platform’s proprietary energy saving technology, which includes multi-objective
optimization, energy efficiency (EE) rules, fault detection (FD) rules and machine learning helps
saving energy to households and business users. The investment needed to start saving and
enjoying benefits is very affordable for home and building users, so their decision is easy and logical.
Business buildings, offices, factories, malls and others facilities have huge potential for
savings too. This potential is so great, that a whole new industry called ESCO – Energy Service
Company has been developed offering a wide range of energy solutions including designs
and implementation of energy savings projects, retrofitting, energy conservation, energy
infrastructure outsourcing, power generation, energy supply and risk management (see https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy service_company) .
ESCO companies made fortunes due to the fact, that they provided two very important benefits:
-

reduced scepticism and risk, so users’ doubts about efficiency are obsolete,
financing.

19 Power selling portfolio is an aggregate of participating connected users, who can physically contribute to create virtual prosumers.

33

REVENUE OF ENERGY SERVICE COMPANIES GLOBALLY
IN 2015, BY REGION (IN BILLION U.S DOLLARS)

Therefore, obviously, energy efficiency is realistic and its performance is good enough to ensure
benefits for user (owner), ESCO and those, who provide financing. All of them have their costs,
overheads, profits, and still ESCO model works for users. Imagine how profitable could an ESCO
business be without overheads, bank fees and all unnecessary costs!
Thanks to the Robotina Platform, this is possible now. Members, who want to utilise their ROX
tokens or equivalent in fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies, can contribute them in the ESCO
crowdfunding. ROX tokens will be used exclusively to crowdfund the energy efficiency projects for
business customers, who have a very high potential to save on energy and maintenance costs.
Unlike other ESCO’s the community will protect the supporters by having buildings always online and the result will be maximized by including users’ assets in the community power-trading
portfolio20 and anonymous data sales program.
How does it work?
•
•
•
•

•

Customer fills in the on-line application.
The platform evaluates (computer software and expert team) the application.
Potential for the energy savings is calculated and evaluated. If estimated that savings are
interesting, a draft proposal is sent to the customer.
When the agreement is signed, Robotina or one of its partners delivers the necessary activities,
installs hardware, connects it to the platform, configures rules and user interfaces and finally
commissions the Cognitive Optimization System.
Savings are automatically calculated and benefits are shared as per the revenue sharing model.

20 Please see other sections of this document

34

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

Revenue sharing model guarantees benefits for the customers and supporters who have
crowdfunded the venture. The revenue sharing model is fine-tuned for every case, but normally
such supporters will get 78 % and customer 20 % of savings during the first three years. Afterwards
savings are shared 49 % each.

The ESCO crowdfunding will enable for a sharing and collaborative economy and a democratic
platform marketplace. Participation in the ESCO crowdfunding will be voluntary. The benefits will
automatically be distributed on a monthly basis.
4.10.2 VIRTUAL POWER PLANT (VPP) CROWDFUNDING
With the development of regulations and growth of utility companies and energy providers, who
provide dynamic energy prices and with the need to provide secondary and tertiary reserves, power trading became very interesting business. Virtual Power Plants (VPP) use real and virtual Prosumers to offer short lasting on-request changes of energy consumption (power). This helps grid
operators to stabilize the electrical grid for which they pay for.
With thousands of IoT things and connected assets, which can be temporally turned on or off on
request, the platform aggregates them and can offer substantial power changes to the grid without
disturbing the users. Users, who have their own IoT, can opt to be included in the power trade portfolio and to benefit from platform’s VPP functionality by selecting it on the platform portal or app.
VPP provides the opportunity for those, who want to contribute their ROX tokens and for those,
who are willing to provide their assets to be included in the power trade portfolio, but do not want
to buy the IoT things like HEMS (Home Energy Management System) Home Controller. They will
both benefit - supporters will earn money from the VPP functionality and users will be able to enjoy
other benefits of having a HEMS controller and the access to the platform.
In addition, VPP will invest in dedicated prosumers, like energy storage systems and occasionally in renewable energy sources. Crowdfunding supporters will contribute to VPP (Virtual Power
Plants) and consequently to a better and more sustainable world

5. COMMUNITY OUTLOOK
5.1 OVERVIEW
The platform will trigger, facilitate and stimulate formation of a community formed by members,
which includes:
•• Users with connected IoT things,
•• Users without IoT things.
Robotina community is comprised of individual social services composed of users within each
of the eight Robotina platform’s products and services (this is subject to change based on
Robotina sole discretion), and users who are participating in at least one of them are a part of a
community. Participating members are entitled to receive reward for their active participation,
from the specific social unites, in which they are participating.
The community will become an important component in the energy sector. Users will enjoy direct
benefits in the form of reduced energy bill, full control over their IoT things and assets, comfort
and new lifestyle, improved safety and security, and new social connections with the community.
In addition to the direct benefits, the community formed on the platform, will provide users
with unique opportunity to earn financial benefits. They will be able to earn Robotina Utility
Tokens (ROX) by:
-

Including their connected IoT and assets in the power selling portfolio;
Participating in cooperative energy purchase;
Selling energy to other users within the platform;
Sharing data with the platform;
Winning community prizes;
Participation on the platform marketplace.

The exact benefits/rewards received by each community member will be calculated based on his
or her active participation within the community (e.g. amount of data shared). Tokens provides
community members with additional utility features, whereas any user will be allowed to become
a member of the Robotina community regardless of whether or not he or she owns a ROX token.
The Robotina Platform will expand the community of members who will be striving to transform
their households and offices (buildings) into facilities with optimized energy consumption and cost.
We will help and guide the community members through the processes of:
1. Gaining awareness of their energy profile;
2. Establishing full control over appliances and their consumption;
3. Planning their adaption of new habits; using AI and connected things for automatic adaption
to the best possible strategy;
4. Starting the production and optimization of their own energy; and
5. Transforming their facilities into energy independent, self-sustainable units.

36

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

Currently, the Robotina Community involves thousands users and we estimate that the
community will scale to at least 10,000,000 members in the next 5 years. The key drivers for a
successful community scale up are:
•

•

•

•

Industry Trends - currently less than 0.1 % of all the devices that could be connected to the
Internet, are connected to the Internet. Just think of the tremendous potential and limitless
opportunities this brings for business and society! The IoT is going to grow tremendously.
Penetration Strategy – with benefits for users based on the utility of the token and a huge
discount on HEMS devices for ICO supporters. Other cryptocurrencies’ or fiat currencies’ users
will be enabled to purchase hardware and enjoy benefits for the currency of their choice –
however, as the ROX token represents our exclusive cryptocurrency, all commissions will be
converted to ROX tokens through cryptocurrency exchanges allowing for the uninterrupted
supply of ROX tokens used for community benefits stocking.
Platform Services & Sharing and Collaborative Economy effects - has the potential to create
tremendous value for both the industry and community as a whole. The platform will upgrade
current processes, infrastructure and systems, and will stimulate willingness to share and
collaborate across the Internet ecosystem.
Positive feedback and scalable participation - even if users can start without connected IoT
and assets, they will usually start with one or more. They will soon discover that besides
gaining direct benefits, they will earn ROX tokens, which will stimulate them to connect more
IoT things and earn more ROX tokens.

5.2 COMMUNITY ECONOMY
The platform is designed to become the most important sharing and collaborative economy
ecosystem dealing with the smart grids. As described in the other sections it provides benefits
to all users and members regardless if they are individual persons with few connected IoT things
or a huge corporation with several sites and thousands of connected IoT things.
ROX token is the platform utility token, which will be used in all transactions within the platform.
By being the exclusive internal cryptocurrency and with all the token-related mechanisms and
utilities described in the other sections, ROX token will be indispensable link between the
platform and community members.
The community will benefit from all transactions on the platform as it will collect incremental parts
from gained benefits21 and use them to run the platform, provide new, more attractive benefits/
reward users for their active participation within the Platform and to finance community projects.

5.3 REVENUE GENERATION PRINCIPLES
As explained, the platform is the main source of income for the community and therefore it is
important to describe and understand the main business models. We predicted several models
and it is impossible to predict all the revenue generation models, which are likely to develop
within the Robotina platform. Models, which are a part of the platform and are detailed in this
document, are designed in a way to guarantee an exponential increase in transactions leading to
the whole Robotina service’s growth and facilitating the wider adoption of the ROX Utility token

37

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

as the core Robotina currency. The platform’s marketplace will be an ideal place for business
initiatives to develop and grow, resulting in new businesses, which will attract new users and
provide more transactions to further increase the community benefits. Whereas additional
transactions will provide an increased source of revenue and different principles will provide
the opportunities to users to obtain benefits/rewards through their active participation, such
dynamics stimulate users to actively collaborate.
5.3.1 SUBSCRIPTION
Users will pay a subscription to use the Robotina platform’s services. Subscriptions will allow users to
enjoy the benefits provided by the platform. Subscriptions will be low and paid monthly – they will
generally cost less than a price of a cappuccino, but with number of users, which is expected to
exceed 1,000,000 in the next two years, subscriptions will become an important source of revenues.
5.3.2 BENEFIT SHARING
Benefit sharing is a model of choice when the Robotina platform will be used to maximize users’
benefits while dealing with the outside world like utilities, energy suppliers and others. It is a good
choice also when B2B customers like commercial buildings use the platform with the ESCO21 model.
This model applies to the platform’s internal services and to the marketplace.
5.3.3 SALES/TRANSACTION COMISSION
The platform will collect sales/transaction commission for sales of hardware and from all transactions
on the marketplace. It will also collect fees for fund management and other newly developed
platform’s functionalities.
5.3.4 COMMUNITY NATIVE PRODUCTS
Besides the above described subscription, benefit sharing and transaction commission, which are
by their nature typical platform fees, the Robotina platform will also generate income by selling data,
e.g. community products in the form of aggregated anonymous data on power profiles, IoT things
behaviour, user requirements and other general or targeted data. The community will continue
developing new products and services.

5.4 NATIVE BUSINESS MODELS
In this section, some of the business models, which have been developed, elaborated and embedded
into the Robotina platform are going to be briefly explained. These business models have been
primarily developed for individual customers, but their usage will be extended to all kinds of
users. We expect to reach at least 1,000,000 users in two years and at least 10,000,000 in five years.
All business models are shown in $ currency for easier evaluation and connection to the
real business environment. In reality all transactions within the Robotina platform will take
place in ROX Utility Tokens. A convenient conversion from and into fiat currency and other
cryptocurrencies will be provided.

5.4.1 SUBSCRIPTIONS
Subscriptions will be the most immediate and obvious income of the platform, which will be used
to finance the platform’s operation and to enable rewarding of the Robotina community members
for their active participation within the platform.

Income from subscriptions will greatly depend on the interest of users to connect and
remain connected to the platform. This is why a great care has been taken while fine tuning
the users’ benefits. 22
SMART CONTRACT will lock in every subscription for a period of 6 months. With the growth
of the community and with more subscriptions paid, less ROX tokens will remain available
on the open market and more tokens will be locked in smart contracts, enhancing the
exclusivity of further subscriptions.

5.4.2 POWER SELLING-VPP
This business model is only possible with IoT things, which are connected to the platform. They
are a part of the Power Selling Portfolio and, when connected to the Robotina platform they gain
Prosumer24 functionality. Community, VPP Crowd fund25 and ESCO crowd fund26 will invest
to provide advanced prosumers like battery storage systems. Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is also a
business model that is a part of the Robotina platform. The platform operates several VPP’s and
actively negotiates the best rates with utilities. The community revenue is shared between the
collaborative community members, supporters and participating users, meaning the community
members are awarded for their active participation within the community.

VPP income generation will grow with increased number of subscribers and with vertical business
cooperative models, which Robotina and the community actively promote23. This one is probably
the most unique, advanced and profitable among the business models. The community funds will
provide investment into prosumers to further increase its income.
Electrical vehicles (EV) and growing number of home battery storage (like Tesla, Robotina,
Sonnen, LG) will further boost this business model. Modern EV’s and batteries are the best
imaginable prosumers and once connected to the platform, they will start bringing revenues
without further investments.
5.4.3 COOPERATIVE (CROWD) ENERGY BUYING
Cooperative energy buying is already practiced in limited cases in the non-connected community,
but can only gain in size and importance once users with or without connected IoT unite on the
platform. Aggregation, smart brokers and blockchain based smart contracts, which will be an
essential part of the Robotina platform, will be the absolute must for this model to be efficient
and profitable.
The platform will be central to the crowd buying collaborative consumption model. It will know the
profiles of participating users (sites), aggregate them and then use artificial intelligence to estimate
possible aggregated profiles. Then it will continuously and dynamically look for best suppliers and
use its aggregated power (and bargaining power) to negotiate the best deal for the users.
The sharing and collaborative economy model, regulated by smart contracts, will distribute most
of the negotiated savings (up to 80 %) to the participating users. The balance will be an income for
the community.

(*)This calculation estimates that only 20 % of the connected sites will participate in the group buying model.

5.4.4 DATA SALES
Businesses (business customers) are interested in at least two types of data. Anonymous and
aggregated data can help them to improve their products, services, algorithms and processes.
On the other hand, non-anonymous data can effectively be used for targeted marketing.
Anonymous data belongs to the community and sales of such data represents its income.We can
estimate that each user will generate one $ monthly in data value; the Robotina community
will collectively earn at least 120.000.000 $ in the fifth year. The platform will continuously
aggregate data and calculate complex real time information. Customers will buy anonymous data
and information sorted and ordered according to the different criteria.
Non-anonymous data will belong to the user. We estimate that 20 % of users will allow their data
to be used by the Robotina platform. The platform will sell usable information in order to trigger
targeted marketing messages. If each participating user whose data are sold gets hundred targeted
messages yearly at a cost of 0,1 $, he will generate 10 $ yearly, meaning an income of 20.000.000 $
at the end of the fifth year. Income will be shared in equal parts between the participating user and
the engaged community members.

5.5 PLATFORM’S MARKETPLACE BUSINESS MODELS
Although the Robotina platform will initially be focused on individual users with the sharing and
collaborative economy model, companies and other business users will have a great incentive
to be part of the platform. The platform and community will gain in value and benefit from the
following business transactions:
•

•

•

Business to Customer (B2C): Millions of users with connected IoT things to whom they can
offer various products and services. Most services will be highly innovative and only possible
with connected IoT. Platform data will help to select potential customers and offer them tailor
made services.
Platform to Business (P2B): The platform benefits, such as enabling energy efficiency, group
buying, and power selling will result in cost reduction and efficiency improvements, which are
important for every business.
Vertical Business Cooperation: Various entities, like utility companies, energy sellers and
others will cooperate to provide new, complex products and services.

41

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

5.5.1 BUSINESS TO CUSTOMER (B2C)
We will use the following assumptions to estimate the volume of B2C business on the platform:
-

Percentage of connected users, who will buy services or get involved with various providers, will
be 10 % during the first year and 20 % and 30 % over the next two years;
The income from each entitled participating user will be 20 $ during the first year and will grow
to 40 $ during the third year.

Using the above assumptions, the volume of B2C business on the platform will reach 80 million $
after three years, which will contribute 16 million $ revenue for the platform.
5.5.2 PLATFORM TO BUSINESS
This platform to business model opens the platform benefits to all kinds of buildings. Building
owners, users and facility management companies will connect their building to the platform and
gain access to all benefits, which will be available for the home users.
Home users focus on safety, comfort, cost and lifestyle. In addition to this, business users will have:
•
•
•
•

Fault Detection (FD) and prediction to dramatically reduce maintenance costs;
Energy efficiency rules;
Facility management support to optimize operations;
Dynamic Dashboards and Key Performance Indicators to understand motivate and implement
the necessary changes.

All business-oriented functionalities are being continuously improved and implemented on the
platform in its Cognitive Optimization System24. We have completed several successful projects25
and demonstrated26 that:

Savings are real, measurable and feasible;
Business model can generate benefits for all participants;
Every building is a candidate for such upgrade.

In our R&D project on behaviour intelligence done together with the Institute Josef Stefan from
Ljubljana (see www.ijs.si ) we have built a full model and have proven 15 % savings without any
substantial reduction in comfort. Our Eco-silver house project, which was sponsored, monitored
and approved by the European Commission within the 7th framework program, delivered impressive
results (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeVbiqdXO_c or http://www.ee-highrise.eu/).
To estimate the potential of this business model, we have to know, that at least 40 % of world’s
electrical energy is consumed to “fuel” buildings. If we assume that only 10 % of all existing
buildings are suitable for implementation of the Energy Efficiency and only 0.1 % of suitable
buildings will be connected to the platform and the average savings will be only 10 % (we can
24 See: 4.3 section

expect savings >15 %), we still get yearly savings of approximately 1.200.000.000 $ (one billion,
two hundred million $) yearly. Savings will be distributed 80 % to supporters (building owners)
and 20 % to the community. The community would earn at least 340 million $ yearly.
The economic savings from Fault Detection and Prediction and other benefits, delivered by the
platform are very similar to the energy savings; therefore, similar outcome for the community is
expected. Power selling (VPP) and group buying will be used in the business environment too.
The ROX Utility token will be the cryptocurrency used to pay for Robotina platform services and to
pay out the benefits gained by the users. With increased business volume, which will soon become
important, the ambition of the community to expand and develop the ROX token into a universal
energy efficiency and power trading cryptocurrency, becomes realistic and feasible.
5.5.3 VERTICAL BUSINESS COOPERATION
Vertical business cooperation between various stakeholders in the energy supply and consumption
chain is natural way to “package” fully integrated solutions and offer them as a “one stop shop”. The
Robotina platform will be important link of the chain, because it is the only stakeholder, which has:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Connected users/entities with IoT;
Important real and virtual aggregated prosumer pool;
Ability to dynamically negotiate deals (brokers);
Blockchain enabled smart contracts;
Utility token ROX ;
The Platform;
Efficient communication mechanisms (community book);
Data;
Hardware, software and expertise to develop or support development on new, connected IoT things.

Robotina has already successfully delivered commercial projects, which include utilising this
business model.27 Value of each project and the economic outcome for community will be
calculated case by case.

5.6 PLATFORM FUNDS AGGREGATOR
As already explained in the 4.2 section, mutual funds will be formed and used by those, who will
want to contribute their ROX tokens into crowd funded business projects or virtual power
plants. Funds will be managed by the community through the platform. Management fees will be
the community’s income. The community will be able to deploy any excess ROX tokens into funds.
With this activity additional income for the community will be generated.

5.7 COMMUNITY EXPENSES
The Robotina community will spend ROX tokens to operate the platform and pay for experts.
Furthermore, funds will be needed to develop new functionalities and new businesses on the
marketplace. ROX tokens will also be used for payments to the users and others in the shared
economy model. The community will continuously need ROX tokens and will be able to either
earn them or buy them on the market.

5.8 PENETRATION STRATEGY
We developed the complete multi-layer penetration strategy, which is facilitated by the extreme
growth of the IoT industry in the area of smart grids. A comprehensive mix of marketing methods,
with an emphasis on digital, will be applied to ensure fast and efficient market penetration.
5.8.1 IoT INDUSTRY TRENDS
The majority of people (87 %) have not heard of the term ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT)while the IoT
industry is growing by around $450 Billion in revenue each year and is currently worth 7.35 Trillion
$. In what might be the most obvious prediction of the decade, the IoT will continue to expand over
the next 5-10 years, with more and more devices coming online every single day.
The smart grid is one of the strongest driving forces for designing the IoT. It is a new paradigm
of designing and operating the electrical power system with the objective to improve efficiency,
enhance service quality, and save cost in power generation, distribution, and consumption. It is
estimated, that 34 % of all IoT industry revenue been generated is by the smart grid community.

5.8.2 INITIAL FAST GROWTH PROGRAM
The Robotina project will allocate a part of the collected ICO funds to develop a community and
distribute first 2,000 basic HEMS (Home Energy Management System) claimed28, FREE OF
CHARGE, other 198,000 at discounted price to the ICO supporters. After the collection of the
funds, 200.000 installation sets will be paid for in order to expand the community. When the user
will register using the back office application, he will receive the HEMS on a “first register, first
received” basis. One member, one profile, one HEMS.

5.8.3 PLATFORM SERVICES - SHARING AND COLLABORATIVE ECONOMY EFFECTS
Expanding the sharing community by commercialization of smart devices and services is the central
pillar for designing our business model. Besides the energy optimization and savings of up to 30
% in costs, some of the future members will be able to get the free installation of their device. The
Robotina Platform will change the energy consumers’ habits and drive new consumers to switch
their behaviour and energy providers.
Robotina will change the perception of the energy markets in households and show them a path to
real or virtual energy independence. The ultimate goal is not to achieve a zero energy house, but
to achieve a zero energy cost home. This is achievable and it will be even possible to earn money
by consuming energy.
Artificial Intelligence driven services will generate value for community customers by reducing their
energy costs, generating revenues and providing them with tools for greater control over their
energy use. Robotina’s predictive analytics and machine learning will provide data and diagnostic
insights for robust and efficient facility energy management.
5.8.4 BUSINESS MODEL – WAY TO THE MARKET
As Robotina we use our existing distributors, resellers and system integrators to build first hand
experience and to achieve initial sales. In this way, we have successfully sold several systems in
more than 25 different markets across the globe. This model served perfectly in the early phase,
but it is necessary to adapt it now, when we are ready to enter the next phase of rapid expansion.
Online to Offline (O2O) business model will prevail with private (non-business) users. Digital, online
marketing will be the main form of getting the message to consumers. We will use all marketing
28 Within 90 days after ICO

45

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

channels and we will widely support content and no-marketing methods. The platform itself will
have built-in marketing tools. We will also deploy other forms of digital marketing too. O2O business
model assumes online sales and offline delivery & installation. TRAINED PARTNERS, selected third
party installers and system integrators will execute the offline part.
Observed from Robotina viewpoint, the O2O business model is a specific combination of B2C
(online) and B2B (offline). Many of our installers and system integrators will also become resellers
of our IoT things. This will increase sales and contribute to faster expansion.
The O2O business model will greatly contribute to a faster growth. On-line sales will
be marketing driven, while off-line sales willresult from various small businesses and
entrepren$ initiatives, which will help us to reach our market penetration goals quickly.
B2B depends on marketing and direct sales. In the B2B business, we will upgrade and enhance
our existing network of B2B partners.
5.8.5 PENETRATION PHASES – ROADMAP
While designing our penetration strategy and deciding geographical priorities, the following key
factors have been considered:
1) DEREGULATION OF THE ENERGY MARKET: Regions with deregulated markets and high
acceptance of smart grids together with well differentiated roles will be prioritised.
2) EASY PENETRATION: Markets, where we are already present and markets with existing
Robotina partners, rank high in this classification. Additionally, favourable regulations boost
this parameter.
3) MARKET SIZE: The bigger the market is, the lower will be the relative investment.
We have multiplied criteria 2 and 3 - (2*3) and then checked this against the 1st criteria. Finally, the
following markets have been ranked and organized in the following table:

7. ROX TOKEN
Robotina Utility Token (ROX) is a utility token that will tokenize the Smart Grid Community
and secure 3 % discount in the Robotina platform marketplace.
ROX will be an ERC-20 standard compliant Ethereum Token, that will be established with a smart
contract, deployed on the Ethereum Network. ROX will have some additional features that extend
the basic ERC-20 standard functionalities. All smart contracts, correlated and developed for ROX
utility token or to support additional functionalities, will become published publically before the
deployment on the Ethereum blockchain for an open review.
As we are well aware of how important it is to provide seamless access to tokens, we will do our best to
ensure the listing ROX token on several reliable cryptocurrency exchanges. There will be no limitation to
the number of tokens owners can send or use for the purposes, described in this document.
With the ownership of the token one will also be able to cooperate within the Robotina community and
as such become eligible to earn certain benefits, in correlation with their active participation. The idea
behind the integration of ROX tokens is allowing Robotina to reward community for their cooperative
behaviour. Consequently, any uncooperative ROX token owners will not become part of Robotina
community and will not be entitled to obtain any benefits at any time. Furthermore, the ownership of
ROX tokens will not entitle owners to dividends, royalties or any other amounts as share of platform’s or
community’s future revenues in whatever form.
Token Generation Event (“the Issuance”) will occur right after the deployment of the initial Smart Contract.

7.1 ROX TOKEN MODEL
One-time Issuance
All ROX tokens will be issued at the Token Generation Event. Smart contract will not enable later
issuances. There will be no staking or similar mechanism to increase the number of tokens in circulation.
No burning/destroying/permanent locking
There is no process to destroy or permanently remove Tokens from circulation. Tokens can be
locked or vested for a predefined number of blocks (or time).
Dilutable
There will be 8 decimal places, so the smallest quant of the ROX token is 10-8 ROX = 0.00000001 ROX.
Transaction Fees
On transactions, a relatively small amount of ROX token will be deducted from a sender of the
transaction. Transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain are expressed as gas and are not subject
of this document.

7.2 ROX TOKENS USE CASES
ROX Utility Tokens can be obtained:

49

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

1. On the ICO in exchange for contributions;
2. At the Robotina platform where you can buy them for fiat money, purchase of an amount of
ROX Tokens will be put into a member’s accounts as an initial balance;
3. Purchases on the secondary markets via online crypto exchanges, if available.
4. As community rewards for active participation (see user benefits)29
5. As a result of business activity on the Robotina Platform
6. In exchange of green certificates (CO2 coupons) or transferable tax benefits
7. As a result of ESCO or VPP crowdfunding platform initiatives
8. From the Bounty Fund
By registering on Robotina platform, users will receive a Platform Account. Some transactions that
can be charged by transaction fee:
1. Transactions - outgoing transactions on Ethereum blockchain, with underlying execution of
blockchain smart contracts;
2. Participation actions, triggered by the member, that require ROX Tokens:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Subscriptions
Sharing collaborative economy activities
ESCO fund participation
VPP pool participation
Group buying
Peer To Peer Power Trade
Business initiatives on marketplace
Voluntary donations
Hardware purchases
Charity activities

ROX token owners who will receive tokens on ICO in exchange for their contributions, will either:
1. Keep ROX tokens on their Ethereum address, or;
2. Transfer them to online cryptocurrency exchanges in order to trade them (if available), or;
3. Transfer them to the Robotina platform where they can be used to perform actions, which
require spending ROX tokens.

7.3 ROX TOKENS CONSUMPTION
Members of Robotina platform community will have several options to use their ROX tokens through
the power platform application:
•• Subscriptions - A required amount of ROX will be charged from the user application
account. Servers that receive and execute subscriptions, will also generate a transaction
that deducts ROX Tokens from the corresponding member’s account.
•• Upgrading the HEMS set - The shop will allow members to order additional smart devices
(e.g. switches and sensors) in exchange for ROX Tokens.
•• Obtaining analytics and statistical data - Different aggregated and processed statistical
data in anonymous form will be obtained about electricity consumption and patterns,
electrical devices, sensor readings, etc.
29 Chapters 4 and 5

50

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

•• Activating alarms and scripts - User will be able to choose between several additional
functionalities, such as sending warnings and statistical data via e-mail and SMS, or receive live
stream of data. Some scripts might analyse unexpected behaviour of electrical devices, such as
malfunctions or poor efficiency. It will also be possible to trigger random events, like switching
lights on at a specific time frame when on vacation to mislead potential burglars.
•• Aggregated actions - Users will be able to activate a set of participation funding cases and
participate in smart grid and business ventures offered on the power platform.
All ROX transactions will deduct different amounts of ROXs from the platform. When the balance of
ROX tokens on the members account is insufficient, the transaction will be denied.

7.4 PAYMENT PROCESSORS
Members will be able to acquire ROX tokens in the Robotina apps with fiat currencies, credit cards
and other cryptocurrencies. The Robotina Platform service will do its best effort to integrate a
solution linked to secondary markets (online cryptocurrency exchanges) and provide members
with a convenient way to access ROX tokens. All purchased tokens will be credited to the account
of the member, allowing him to use the tokens directly after the purchase.

7.5 ROX TOKEN LEGAL STATUS
ROX tokens represent a proof of membership within Robotina platform. They do not grant ownership
rights to Robotina proprietary software, algorithms, and other intellectual property. Furthermore,
ROX tokens do not give its owner any kind of share or equity in any of Robotina legal entities, and
do not entitle the ROX owner to dividends or profits of any kind. ROX token is not intended to
constitute a security or any other form of regulated financial instrument. The legal nature of ROX
token will be further described in “General Terms and Conditions.”

7.6 BOUNTY FUND
The Bounty Fund will collect and distribute ROX tokens, received from token allocation event. Each
Bounty Fund participant will get rewarded with ROX tokens from the Bounty Fund for social media
actions, such as promoting a crowdsale until it finishes.
Bounty Fund Manager
The Robotina Project will manage the Bounty Fund and report periodically about the ROX tokens balance
to all community members. Reports will be available on the Robotina’s official social media pages.
Beneficiaries
Members, that:
1. Agree with General Terms and Privacy Policy;
2. Register as Bounty Members.
Distribution
ROX tokens from the Bounty Fund will be periodically distributed according to Bounty Fund Plan.

8. INITIAL COIN OFFERING (ICO) - CROWDSALE
8.1 WHY YOU SHOULD SUPPORT ROBOTINA?
A public Initial Coin Offering (ICO) will take place in order to collect subscriptions from supporters
and to award them with ROX tokens.
TOKEN GENERATION EVENT
All tokens sold will be generated after the ICO (1st May, 2018). Later issuances will be disabled in
the smart contract for ever.
TOKEN DISTRIBUTION
When issued, ROX tokens will be temporary locked until the end of the ICO phase.
After the successful ICO phase, ROX tokens will be distributed to registered Ethereum Addresses,
according to the following Token Distribution Plan:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

70 % (570,500,000 ROX) among ICO supporters;
10 % among Team Members and Advisors;
7 % - Marketing and promotion;
5 % - Angel investors;
3 % - Bounty Fund;
3 % - Market and product development;
2 % - Escrow.

Tokens for Team Members, Advisors and Business Partners (10 %) will be vested for a period
of 6 months - they will be unable to move or sell their ROX tokens. After this period the ROX
tokens will gradually be transferred to Team Members and Advisors - each month 10 % of
initially vested amount.
PRE - ICO START
Planned on February 21, 2018, 3:00 PM CET.
ICO START
Planned on March 21, 2018, 3:00 PM CET.
PHASES
There will be 3 crowd sale phases:
(1) Pre-ICO Limited Priority (maximum 4 weeks - until March 21, 2018, 2:59 PM CET);
(2) ICO - Unlimited Priority (lasts until this phase’s Hard Cap is reached);
(3) Unlimited Unlisted Phase (lasts till ICO Total Hard Cap is reached or April 30, 2018, 2:59 PM CET);
First two phases are reserved for individuals, enlisted on the Priority List.

52

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

PRIORITY LIST
Early supporters, that already showed an interest to participate in the crowd sale, will be added to
the Priority List. All other interested individuals will have an opportunity to register on the Priority
List with their Ethereum addresses, giving them the possibility to participate in the first two ICO
phases (Limited Priority and Unlimited Priority). A consecutive order will be enforced.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Contributions will be collected in Ethereum (ETH). Swap ratio between ROX token and other
cryptocurrencies will be determined and fixed during a period of each crowd sale phase, based on
average market value of each cryptocurrency – an average market exchange ratio will be used for
the calculation of subscription value.
Minimum subscription is set to 0.5 ETH of value.
MINIMUM COLLECTED VALUE - THRESHOLD FOR SUCCESS
Minimum value of all contributions is set to 10,000,000 $. If this value is not collected at the end of
last ICO phase, all contributions will be reimbursed to supporters, less transaction fees which will
be deducted.
HARD CAP - MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION SUM
Maximum collected value is set to 28,500,000 $. In case the total value exceeds this limit before
the end of ICO, the ICO will be suspended and a calculation phase will start. After reaching the
Hard Cap, no further contributions will be accepted, resulting in returning all contributions to the
originating ETH addresses.
ICO MECHANISM
For contributions in ETH, server-side technology will collect the amounts, send them to collecting
address and calculate the ROX acquired by the subscriber based on his donation. The collecting
address will be publicly announced on the Robotina ICO official web site.
PHASE CAPS
Each phase is limited with it’s own cap:
1. Limited Priority - 15,500,000 $
2. Unlimited Priority - 7,000,000 $
3. Unlimited Unlisted Phase - 6,025,000 $
If the sum in value of contributions, received at the time of Limited Priority, exceeds the phase
cap, that phase is automatically concluded and later contributions are returned to corresponding
senders’ addresses.
TRANSFERS TO LATER PHASES
In case those contributions in that particular phase do not reach the phase cap, the shortfall in
value will be transferred to next phase, along with not-distributed tokens. Due to this transfer, the
ICO phases can expand in value and dedicated tokens.
BONUS PROGRAM
Contributors in the Limited Priority Phase will receive bonus of 10 % and in the Unlimited Priority
Phase will receive a bonus of 5 %.

53

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

No guarantee is given, that all contributors will receive bonuses in tokens, as phases are limited in
value and consecutive order of contributions is respected. If the total sum value of contributions
will exceed a limitation, first received contributions (15.5 mio. $) will receive a 10 % bonus and later
received contributions will receive 5 % or 0 % bonus.
However, no guarantee is given that all the subscribed supporters will get through, since the overall
hard cap is set to 28.5 million $ which equates to 570,500,000.00 ROXs.
UNSOLD TOKENS
Potentially unsold tokens reserved for crowd sale will never be created.
EQUATION FOR ESTIMATION
To calculate the approximate number of ROX tokens you can expect to receive the following equation
sets this out. This equation does not respect all possible potential outcomes during the sale, such
as splitting of a single contribution, phase transfers or partial haircuts. It should not be used as a
guarantee of actual ROX tokens to be received or an exact calculation but for guideline purposes only.
Value contributed * (1+bonus)
* ROX issued for sale on ICO = ROX received
Total ICO Value

Example:
A supporter sends in ETH an amount worth 400,000 $ at the time of contribution. His subscription
is successfully accepted during the Limited Priority phase (with 10 % bonus).
Value contributed: 400.000 $
Bonus: 10 % = 0,1
Total ICO value with bonuses: 30.425.000$
All Tokens issued for sale on ICO: 570,500,000 ROX
400.000$ * 1.1 (bonus)
* 570,500,000 ROX = 8,250,451 ROX received

CALCULATION AND HAIRCUT
After the conclusion of the ICO phases, a calculation of all the payments, bonuses and corresponding
ROX tokens will be carried out. A haircut process might follow: the contributions collected in the last
effective ICO phase might not be fully accepted, part of a contributed value might be returned to
contributors and will not be swapped for ROX tokens.

8.2 HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN A CROWDSALE
All interested individuals will be able to participate in the ICO, either during the first two Limited
Phases or later on during a public phase, if the ICO will does not end early due to the hard cap
limitations. Interested individuals are encouraged to pay as soon as possible after the ICO starts,
due to the possible reduction of the ICO period. Failure to subscribe in the ICO period will mean
that you do not receive ROX Tokens.

54

WWW.ROBOTINAICO.COM

A smart contract Ethereum address for ETH contributions will be publicly published on the official
Robotina website www.Robotinaico.com
A contributor in ETH will have to transact Ethereum (ETH) from a private Ethereum sddress with full
access, i.e. not from the online cryptocurrency exchange account. After the end of the ICO period,
calculation and haircut period, you will receive a corresponding amount of ROX tokens on the same
Ethereum address, from which you contributed.
Additional step-by-step guides for different Ethereum Wallets will be available on the Robotina
ICO website.

8.4 SECURITY
Robotina will follow rigid guidelines of internal and external compliance to influence industry
practices and establish itself as the credible Smart House Community in the blockchain industry.
All digital assets under Robotina’s ownership will be distributed among different multi signature
wallets. None of the wallets or transactional accounts will have a single point access. Access will
be distributed and rotated in accordance with internal compliance factors. None of the wallets
or transactional accounts will hold more than 10 % of the total assets. Recovery phrases and key
access codes will be secured at the designated bank without a single person having access. This will
be further clarified in the “General Terms and Conditions”.
Security guidelines will include, but will not be limited to: performing internal compliance checks,
monitoring of effectiveness, eliminating one-point access to the running of data algorithms and
stored assets, performing a third-party audit report, ensuring the integrity of data sources, fulfilling
of background checks for business partners, transparency of accounting figures, and disclosure of
private holdings or other decision influencing factors.
Robotina will have an independent auditing process, which will be performed by a third party on an
annual basis. The report will cover:
••
••
••
••

Stated balance in terms of assets at fund inception;
Overview of placed, burned, and executed transactions;
Community effectiveness and proposed optimization strategies;
Evaluation of compliance procedures and identified shortcomings.

The third party auditing company will be disclosed via a press release before the inception of the
Robotina platform.

ICO - Initial Coin Offering
Is a means of crowdfunding centered around cryptocurrency, which can be a source of capital
for projects.
Floor
ROBOTINA team estimates that the project is not feasible if less than 10 million $ is invested. If 10
million $ investment is not reached during the ICO - smart contract will automatically return money
to investors and project will not continue.
Haircut
ROBOTINA aims to raise 28,525 million $ in ICO. If person A supports the project with 1250 $ (or
equivalent in Ethereum) and the total amount raised will be 35 million $, smart contract will accept
only 1018.75 $ (or equivalent in Ethereum) from person A and return him/her 231.25 $
Hard cap
ROBOTINA team has estimated that project with over 28.525 million $ will be too hard to manage
due to demanding supply and distribution of ROBOTINA devices and due to potential lower quality
of services for individuals beyond a certain scale. That is why project is limited to 28.525 million $.
Investors above 28.525 million $ will be haircut.
Smart contract
Is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or
performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without
third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible

Utility Token
The utility tokens are services or units of services that can be purchased. These tokens can be
compared to API keys, used to access the service. They are a way to fund projects of shared
infrastructure that couldn’t be funded before. To enable such ecosystems to be built some tokens
can be “pre-mined” in addition to be sold in “crowd-sales” during tokens launches.
Vesting period
As part of the dedication of a team, all involved in ICO will have their tokens locked up for a year
in order to avoid overflowing the market with ROX tokens, before secondary ROX market is fully
developed.
